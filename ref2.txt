phantasmagoria a string of ghost stories the queens cadet i have been forced to believe in the existence and influence of an unseen world of something which is described in that line of drydens with silent steps i follow you all day i have felt the influence of the spiritual and invisible on the senses though i know nothing of the complications the deceptions and alleged perils forming a portion of that which is now termed spiritualism and which affirms that the unseen world cannot become manifest save in obedience to certain occult laws which regulate the phenomena of nature what rigmarole was this could the speakerthis man with the melancholy tone and saddened eyeactually be the same handsome jack arkley my old college chum at sandhurst who was always rather sceptical even in religious matters who was one of the merriest fellows there who had been once nearly rusticated for breaking the lamps and dismounting the guns to spite the adjutant but who as a queens cadet had more marks of excellence than any of us who was afterwards the beauideal of a fine young english officera prime bat and bowler who pulled a good stroke oar had such a firm seat in his saddle and who was the best hand for organizing a picnic a ball or a scratch company for amateur theatricals and who in the late expedition against the looshais had won the reputation of being a regular fireeatera fellow who would face the devil in his shirt sleeves could the champagne of the rag have affected him thought i as he continued earnestly and sadly and while manipulating a cigar selected from the silver stand on the table i have somewhere read that very few persons in this world have been unfortunate enough to have seen those things that are invisible to others by jove do you mean aghost not exactly the vulgar ghost of the nursery said he his pale face colouring slightly but we have all met with those who knew some one else who had seen something weird unearthly unexplainable precisely but i shall speak from personal experienceso now for a little narrative of my own we had dined that evening at the club where d of the greys had given a few fellows a dinner in honour of being gazetted to his troop and to wet the new commission and though it seemed to me that like the rest of us jack arkley had done justice to all the good things set before him from the soup to the coffee and curaçao he had been during dinner remarkably triste or abstracted and took but little interest in the subjects discussed by the guests who were mostly all upon short leave from aldershot and the spring drills being over were thankful to exchange the white dust of the long valley for the row or regent street we were alone now and lingering over some iced brandypawnee as we called it in india in the cool baywindow of his room in piccadilly where it overlooked the pleasant green park and where the clock of westminster was shining above the trees like a red harvest moon so i prepared to listen to him with more curiosity than belief while he related the following singular story which he would never have ventured to relate to the circle of heedless fellows whom we had just left my parents died when i was little more than an infant leaving me to the care of two uncles a maternal one named beverley a man of considerable wealth who in consequence of a quarrel with my father whose marriage with his sister he resented totally ignored my existence and was ever a kind of myth to me the other a paternal one a bachelor curate in north wales poor old morgan apreece arkley than whom there was no better or more kindhearted man in all the principality his means were most limited but to share the little he possessed he made me freely and tenderly welcome all the more so that to two appeals he had made to the generosity of my uncle beverley no response was ever returneda cutting coldness and rudeness bitterly resented by my hottempered but warmhearted old welsh kinsman a career was necessarily chosen for me the death of my father on duty at benares enabled me to be borne on the strength of the military college at sandhurst as one of the twenty queens cadets and to that seminary i repaired a few months after you did when in my sixteenth year leaving with sincere sorrow the lonely whitehaired man who had been as a parent to me and whose secluded parsonage by the margin of llyn ogwen and under the shadow of carneydd davydd had been the only home i could remember there for years he had been my earnest and anxious tutor mingling with the classics a store of quaint old welsh legends and ancient songs for he was an excellent and enthusiastic harper and had come of a long line of harpers prior to this change in my life i encountered an adventure which has had considerable influence in my after career from childhood i had been familiar with the mountains that overhang llyn ogwen i knew every track and rock and fissure of carneydd davydd of the black ladders of carneydd llewellyn and the brows of the greater giant of the three cloudcapped snowdon for miles upon miles among them i had been wont to wander with my gun and at times to aid the shepherds in tracking out lost sheep or goats by places where we looked down upon the gray mist and vapour that floated below us and where the mountain peaks seemed to start out of it like isles amid a sea in the heart of such solitudes as these i found food for much reflective thought and was wont to give full swing to my boyish fancies under every variety of season and weather i was wont to wander among these mountains sometimes when their sides seemed to vibrate under the hot rays of a cloudless summer sun at others when the glistening snow lay deep in the passes and valleys or when height and hollow were alike shrouded in thick and impenetrable mist but my favourite spot was ever llyn idwal the wildest and most savage of all our welsh lakes it fills the crater of an ancient volcano and is the traditional scene of the murder of idwal a prince of wales who was flung over its precipicea place which for gloomy grandeur has no equal as the bare rocks that start out of it sheer as a wall darken by their shadows its depth to the most intense blackness and the peasants aver that no fish can swim in it and no bird fly over it and live lying upon the mountain tops amid the purple heather or the scented thymegrass i was wont to watch the distant waters of the channel stretching far away beyond the puffin isle and great ormes head ever changing in hue as the masses of cloud skimmed over them and from thence i followed with eager eyes the white sails of the ships or the long smoky pennants of the steamers that were bound forah where were they bound forand so far from the solitary parsonage of the good old man who loved me so well i was ungrateful enough to follow to distant isles and shores these vanishing specks in the spirit i see that you are impatient to know what all this preamble has to do with sandhurst and the melancholy which now oppresses me but nevertheless i am fast coming to the matterto that keystone of the soul which must exist in every nature one day i was up a wild part of the mountains far above llyn ogwen a long and narrow sheet of water which occupies the whole pass between braichddu and the shoulder of carneydd davydd my sole companion was my dog cidwmin english wolfwhich lay beside me on the sunny grass when from one of my daydreams i was suddenly roused by voices and found three persons close beside me mounted on sturdy welsh ponies two of these were a gentleman in the prime of life and a very young lady apparently his daughter attended by david lloyd one of the guides for the district who knew me well he led the bridle of the girls pony with one hand and grasped his alpenstock with the other this group paused near me and some conversation ensued lloyd had evidently mistaken the path and was loath to admit the fact or to suggest that they should retrace their steps and yet he knew enough of the mountains to be well aware that to advance would be to court danger during the colloquy that ensued between him and his employer a haughty and imperiouslooking man i was earnestly gazing in the halfaverted face of the girl who was watching an eagle in full flight she was marvellously beautiful her featuressave in profilewere perhaps far from correct yet there was a divine delicacy a charming purity of complexion and brightness of expression over them all and her minute face seemed to nestle amid the masses of her fair rippling hair she turned towards me and her eyes met mine they were dark violet blue and shaded by brown lashes so long that they imparted much of softness to their dovelike expression and she smiled for no doubt the little maid saw that there was something of unequivocal admiration to be read in my ardent gaze and so absorbed was i that for a few seconds i was not aware that the guide was addressing me and inquiring how far the path was traversable in this particular direction ere i could reply how should this mere lad know if you dont asked the male tourist haughtily and sharply few here can know better sir replied lloyd i have seen him climb where the eagles alone can go shall we proceed then he asked me sharply i think not sir said i moel hebog was covered with mist this morning and but moel hebog is clear enough now said david lloyd with irritationthe mountain so named being deemed an unerring barometer as regards the chances of mist upon its greater brethrenso i think we may proceed he added touching his hat to his employer i dont require sir to be taught my trade by a mere lad a gentleman tho you be master arkley arkley repeated the stranger starting and eyeing me keenly and yet with a lowering expression of face i warned them of the danger of farther progression but the avaricious guide derided me and i heard his employer as they passed on asking him some questions amid whichbut it might be fancyi thought my own name occurred i gazed after them with interest and with much of anxiety for their path was perilous and the sweet soft beauty of the girl had impressed me deeply and as she disappeared with all her wealth of golden hair the brightness seemed to have departed from the mountain side what was the magic this creature whom i had only seen for a few minutes possessed for me she was scarcely a woman yet past childhood and her features remained as distinctly impressed upon my memory as if they were before me still do not infer from this strange interest that love at first sight as the novels used to have it was an ingredient of this emotion no it was something deepera subtle magnetismsomething that i know not how to define or to express and with a repining sigh i thought of my lonely life and longed to go forth on the career that awaited me beyond those green mountains that were bounded by the sea had i ever seen that fair little face before or dreamed of it by night or by day that already it seemed to haunt me so the little group had not disappeared above five minutes when a sound like a cry was borne past me on the mountain breeze i started up my heart beating wildly and with undefined apprehension hastened in the direction of the sound while wolf careered in front of me there now came the sound of hoofs and with bridle trailing saddle reversed and nostrils distended the pony on which i had so recently seen the young girl came tearing over the crest of the hill and galloped madly past me towards llyn idwal quicker beat my heart and my breath came thick and fast something dreadful had taken place true to his instincts as ever was the faithful gelert of the welsh tradition wolf sped in haste to the edge of what i knew to be a frightful ravine there the hoof marks were fresh in the turf the edge of which was broken the grass too was crushed and torn as if something had fallen over it the dog now paused lifted up his nose and howled ominously i peered over and far down below on a ledge of green turf but perilously overhanging a chasm in the mountain side lay that which appeared at first to be a mere bundle of clothes but which i knew to be the little maiden dead doubtlessly deadand a wail of sorrow escaped me her father and the guide had disappeared partly sliding partly descending as if by a natural ladder finding footing and grasp where many might have found neither mechanically and as one in a dream i reached her in about ten minutes and as i had a naturally boyish dread of facing death with joy i saw her move and then took her in my arms tenderly and caressingly while she opened her eyes and sighed deeply for the fall had stunned and shaken her severely otherwise she was happily uninjured but i had reached her just in time for if left to herself she must have tottered and fallen into the terrible profundity below papa oh where is my papa i was thrown suddenly from my ponya bird scared itand remember no more then a passion of tears and terror came over her with the consciousness of the peril she had escaped and that which still menaced her for to ascend was quite impracticable and to descend seemed nearly equally so above us the mountain side seemed to rise like a wall of rock on the other hand at the bottom of the ravine where the shadows of evening were dark and blue though sunset still tipped snowdons peaks with fire and clouds of crimson and gold were floating above us i could see a rivulet a tributary of the ogwen glittering like a silver thread far down perhaps a thousand feet below courage said i while for a time my heart died within me i shall soon conduct you to a place of safety but papa he will die of fright where is my papa she exclaimed piteously gone round some other way i suggested and subsequently this proved to be the case placing an arm round her for aid we now began to descend but slowly the face of the hill which was there so steep and shelved so abruptly that to lose one step might have precipitated us to the bottom with a speed that would have insured destruction from rock to rock from bush to bush and from cleft to cleft i guided and often lifted her sometimes with her eyes closed and gazed the while with boyish rapture on the beautiful girl as her head drooped upon my shoulder she had lost her hat and the unbound masses of her golden hair blown by the wind came in silken ripples across my face and delight mingled with alarm bewildered me till that hour no sorrow could have affected a spirit so pure as hers and certainly love could not have agitated itshe was so young but when we drew nearer the base of the hill and reached a place of perfect safety the soft colour came back to her face and the enchantment of her smile was as indescribable as the clear violet blue of her eye which filled with wonder and terror as she gazed upward to the giddy verge from which she had partly fallen and then a little shudder came over her with a boys ready ardour i was already beginning to dream of being beloved by her when excited voices came on the wind and round an angle of the ravine into which we had descended came lloyd the guide several peasants and her father who had partially witnessed our progress and whose joy in finding her alive and well when he might have found her dashed perhaps out of the very semblance of humanity was too great for words the poor man wept like a very woman as he embraced her again and again and muttered in broken accents his gratitude to me and praise of my courage suddenly he exclaimed to the guide you said his name wasarkley i think yes sir replied lloyd john beverley arkley nephew of the curate at the foot of the mountain yonder he added turning to me the same sir good heavens i am your uncle beverley said he colouring deeply and taking my hand again in his the girl you have saved is your own cousinmy darling eve i owe you some reparation for past neglect so come with me to the parsonage at once here was a discovery that quite took away my breath so this dazzling little hebe was my cousin how fondly i cherished and thought over this mysterious tie of bloodnear almost as a sister and yet no sister it was very sweet to ponder over and to nurse the thoughts of affection and all that yet might be what a happy happy night was that in the ancient parsonage the good old curate forgave uncle beverley all the shortcomings in the years that were past and seemed never to weary of caressing the wonderful hair and the tiny hands of evelyn beverley for such was her name though familiarly known as eve it is quite a romance this said kind uncle arkley to his brotherinlaw the young folks will be falling in love eve grew quite pale and cast down her eyes while i blushed furiously stuff said uncle beverley somewhat sharply she has barely cut her primers and pinafores and jack has sandhurst before him yet he presented me with his gold repeater and departed by the first convenient train taking my newlydiscovered relation with him i had a warm invitation to visit them for a few weeks before entering at sandhurst and to add to my joy and impatience i found that beverley lodge was in berkshire and within a mile of the college and so but for the presence of the golden gift and the memory of a kind and grateful kiss from a beautiful lipa kiss that made every nerve thrilli might have imagined that the whole adventure on the slopes of carneydd davydd was but a dream naturally avaricious cold and hard in heart mr beverley had warmed to me for a time but a time only yet i revered and almost loved him he was the only brother of my dead mother whom i had never known shethis goldenhaired girlwas of her blood and had her name so my whole soul clung to her with an amount of youthful ardour such as i cannot portray to youfor i was always much of an enthusiastand i was again alone to indulge in the old tenor of my ways amid the voiceless mountain solitudes again and again in my lonely wanderings had my mind been full of vague longings and boyish aspirations after glory pleasure and love and now the memory of eves minute and perfect faceso pure and english in its beautyby its reality filled up all that had been a blank before and i was ever in fancied communion with her while lying on the hillslopes and looking to the sea that sparkled at the far horizon into the black ravines through which the mountain brooks went foaming to the rocky shore or where our deep welsh llyns were gleaming in the sunshine like gold and turquoise blueamid the monotony of the silent woods and so the time passed on and the day came when i was to start for beverley lodge and thence to sandhurst while love and ambition rendered me selfishly oblivious of poor old uncle morgan and the fervent wishes and blessings with which he followed my departing steps a months visit to beverley lodge amid the fertility of berkshire many a ride and ramble in the vale of the white horse many an hour spent by us together in the shady woods the luxurious garden in the beautiful conservatory and in the deep leafy lanes where we wandered at will confirmed the love my cousin and i bore each other a boy and a girl it came easily about while many were our regrets and much was our marvelling that we had not known each other earlier no two men make a declaration of love perhaps in precisely the same way though it all comes to the same thing in the end but it might be interesting to know in what precise terms and having so little choice father adam declared his passion for mother eve and in what fashion she responded i know not now how my love for my little eve was expressed but told it was and i departed for college the happiest student there every hour i could spare from study and drill being spent in or about beverley lodge with an income of forty pounds per annum till gazetted i almost thought myself rich and i had three years before meit seemed an eternity of joyto look forward to at sandhurst i was as you know entered as a queens cadet free and a candidate for the infantry i had thus to master algebra the three first books of euclid french german and higher fortification but in the pages of straith amid the ravelins of vauban and the casemates of coehorn i seemed to see only the name and the tender eyes of eve the daily drills in which i was at first an enthusiast became dull and prosaic and hourly i made terrible mistakes for eves voice was ever in my ear and her delicate beauty haunted me for wondrously delicate it became as consumptionwhich she fatally inherited from her mothershed over it a medium that was alike soft and alluring since then i have met girls of all kinds everywhere though only a sub i have been dressed for played for sung for but never have i had the delight of those remembered days that were passed with eve beverley in our dream of cousinly love however a rude waking was at hand when she was eighteen and i a year older she told me one day that her father had been insisting upon her marrying an old friend of his a retired sudder judge who had proposed in form but she had laughed at the idea absurd it is so funny of papa to have a husband ready cut and dry for me is it not jack said she i did not think so but my heart beat painfully as i leaned caressingly over her and played with her beautiful hair i dont thank him for selecting a husband for me jack dear she continued pouting do you certainly not eve but i must prepare my mind for the awful event said she looking up at me with a bright waggish smile the time was fast approaching however when neither of us could see anything funny in the prospect for the awful event became alarmingly palpable when one day she met me with tears and threw herself on my breast saying save me dearest jacksave me from whom papa and his odious old sudder judge jack love you know that i must marry you and you only the devil he does said a voice sharply and there grim as ajax stood uncle beverley with hands clenched and brows knit my sister married his father a beggar with only his pay and now minx you dare to love their son by heavens with no pay at all leave this house sirbegone instantly he added furiously to me i would rather that she had broken her neck on the mountains than treated me to a scene like this the gates of beverley lodge closed behind me and our dream was over half my life seemed to have left me after three years of such delightful intercourse i could not adopt the conviction that i should never see her again and in a very unenviable state of mind i entered the college where you may remember meeting me under the doric portico and saying whats up jack but let me congratulate you on what i asked sulkily your appointment to the buffs the gazette has just come from town they are stationed at jubbulpore and so it proved that the very day i lost her saw me in the service with india and a far and final separation before us necessity compelled us to prepare for an almost instant departure short leave was given me by the adjutantgeneral and i had to join the candahar transport going with drafts from chatham for the east on a certain day rumours reached me of eve being seriously ill she was secluded from me and there was every chance that i should see her no more a letter came from her imploring me to meet her for the last time at a spot known to us botha green lane that led to a churchyard stilethe scene of many a tender tryst and blissful hour as it was a place where overhanging trees with the golden apple the purple damson and the plum formed a very bower and where few or none ever came save on sunday and there we met for the last time there once again her head lay on my shoulder my circling arm was round her and her hot tremulous hand was clasped in mine i was shocked by the change i perceived in her painful was her pallor to look upon there were circles dark as her lashes under her sad melancholy eyes her nostrils and lips were unnaturally pink she had a short dry cough and blood appeared more than once upon her handkerchief consumption on one hand and parental tyranny on the other were fast doing their fatal work her father was pitiless and inexorablewonderfully infamously so as he was so rich that mere money was no object and as she was his only child and one so tender and so fragile his studied system of deliberate worry had wrung a consent from her she was to marry the old judge and in more ways than one i felt that too surely i was losing her for ever she could not go out with me i felt desperate and in silence folded her again and again to my breast at last the tingtong of the old church clock announced the hour when we must part never to meet again and the fatal sound struck us like a shock of electricity jack my dearestmy dearest she whispered wildly i dont think i shall live very long now i maynay i must die very soon but the spirit is imperishable and i shall always be with you wherever you may be wherever you may go hovering near you i hope like a guardian angel her words struck me as strange and wild i did not attach much importance to them then but they have had a strange and terrible significance since would you welcome me she asked with a mournful smile dead or living shall i welcome you i replied with mournful ardour then kiss me once again dear jack and now we partin this world at least another wild passionate embrace and all was over in a minute later i was galloping far from the villa to reach the railway i saw her beloved face no more but voice and face eye and kiss were all with me still would a time ever come when i might forgot them adverse winds detained us long in the channel but we cleared it at last and the last times that came on board announced the marriage of this unhappy girl six months subsequent found me in cantonments at neemuch with a small detachment of ours and in hourly expectation of the mutiny which had broken out at meerut and delhi with such horrors being imitated there though we had sworn the sepoys to be true to their salt the mahometans on the koran the hindoos on the waters of the ganges and the other darkies on whatever was most sacred to them and if they revolted all europeans were to seek instant shelter in the fort it was the night of the 3rd juneone of the loveliest i ever saw in indiathe moonlight was radiant as midday and not a cloud was visible throughout the blue expanse of heaven i was lying in my bungalow with sword and revolver beside me as we could not count upon the events of an hour for all hindostan seemed to be going to chaos in blood and outrage the cantonment ghurries had clanged midnight my eyes were closing heavily and when just about to sleep i thought that my name was uttered by some one near me very softly very tenderly and with an accent that thrilled my hearts core starting i looked up and thereoh my godthere in the slanting light of the moon like a glorified spirit with a brightness all about her was the figure of eve beverley bending over me with all her golden hair unbound and a garment like a shroud or robe about her entranced enchained by love as much as by mortal terror i could not move or speak while nearer she bent to kiss my brow but i felt not the pressure of her lips though reading in her starry violet eyes a divine intensity of expressiona mournful unspeakable tenderness when pointing in the direction of the fort she disappeared it is a dreada dreadful dream said i starting to my feet preternaturally awake to hear the sound of artillery the rattle of musketry the yells of deen deen and the shrieks of those who were perishing for the mutineers had risen and the 1st cavalry the 72nd n i and walkers artillery had commenced the work of massacre i rushed forth and at the moment i left my bungalow on one side it was set in flames and fired through from the other i fled to the fort which thanks to my dreamfor such i supposed it to bei reached in safety while many perished for all the station was sheeted now with flame once again i had that dream so wild and strange when a deadly peril threatened me i was hiding in the jungle alone and in great misery near jehazghur a fugitive the time was noon and i had dropped asleep under the deep cool shadow of a thicket when that weird vision of eve came before me soft and sad tender and intense with her loving eyes and flowing hair as with hands outstretched she beckoned me to follow her a cry escaped me and i awoke was my eve indeed dead i asked of myself and was it her intellectual spirit her pure essence that imperishable something engendered in us all from a higher source that followed me as a guardian angel i remembered her parting words the idea suggested was sadly sweet and terrible and so as a sense of her perpetual presence as a spiritwife hovered at all times about me controlling all my actions rendered me unfit for society till at calcutta a crisis was put to all this with some of the 72nd and other europeans who had escaped from neemuch or had distinguished themselves as the hurkaru had it i once went to be photographed at the famous studio near the corner of the strand i sat in succession alone and in a group after being posed in the usual fashion with an iron hoop at the nape of my neck on examining the first negative an expression of perplexity and astonishment came over the face of the artist strange sir said he most unaccountable what is strange what is unaccountable asked several another figure that is not in the room appears at captain arkleys backa woman by jove he replied placing the glass over a piece of black velvet and therethereoh there could be no doubt of itwas faintly indicated the outline of one whose face and form had been but too vividly impressed on my heart and brain bending sorrowfully over me with her soft bright eyes and wealth of long bright hair from my hand the glass fell on the floor and was shivered to atoms a similar figure hovering near me was visible among the pictured group of officers but faded out i refused to sit again and quitted the studio in utter confusion and with nerves dreadfully shaken though my comrades averred that a trick had been played upon me if so how was the figure that of my dreamthat of my lost lovewho a letter soon after informed me had burst a bloodvessel and expired on the night of the 3rd june with my name on her lips such was the story of jack arkley whether it was false or true in this age of spiritualism and many other isms of mediums with the world unseen and in which enemoser has ventilated his theory of polarity i pretend not to say and leave others to determine he became a moody monomaniac i rejoined my regiment and from that time never saw my old chum again the last that i heard of him was that he had quitted the service and died a passionist father in one of the many new monastic institutions that exist in the great metropolis the spectre hand do the dead ever revisit this earth on this subject even the ponderous and unsentimental dr johnson was of opinion that to maintain they did not was to oppose the concurrent and unvarying testimony of all ages and nations as there was no people so barbarous and none so civilized but among whom apparitions of the dead were related and believed in that which is doubted by single cavillers he adds can very little weaken the general evidence and some who deny it with their tongues confess it by their fears in the august of last year i found myself with three friends when on a northern tour at the hôtel de scandinavie in the long and handsome carl johan gade of christiania a single day or little more had sufficed us to do all the lions of the little norwegian capitalthe royal palace a stately white building guarded by slouching norski riflemen in long coats with wideawakes and green plumes the great brick edifice wherein the storthing is held and where the red lion appears on everything from the kings throne to the hallporters coalscuttle the castle of aggerhuis and its petty armoury with a single suit of mail and the long muskets of the scots who fell at rhomsdhal after which there is nothing more to be seen and when the little tivoli gardens close at ten all christiania goes to sleep till dawn next morning english carriages being perfectly useless in norway we had ordered four of the native carrioles for our departure as we were resolved to start for the wild mountainous district named the dovrefeld when a delay in the arrival of certain letters compelled me to remain two days behind my companions who promised to await me at rodnaes near the head of the magnificent ransfiord and this partial separation with the subsequent circumstance of having to travel alone through districts that were totally strange to me with but a very slight knowledge of the language were the means of bringing to my knowledge the story i am about to relate the table dhôte is over by two oclock in the fashionable hotels of christiania so about four in the afternoon i quitted the city the streets and architecture of which resemble portions of tottenham court road with stray bits of old chester in my carriole a comfortable kind of gig were my portmanteau and guncase these with my whole person and indeed the body of the vehicle itself being covered by one of those huge tarpaulin cloaks furnished by the carriole company in the store standgade though the rain was beginning to fall with a force and density peculiarly norse when i left behind me the redtiled city with all its green coppered spires i could not but be struck by the bold beauty of the scenery as the strong little horse at a rasping pace tore the light carriole along the rough mountain road which was bordered by natural forests of dark and solemnlooking pines interspersed with graceful silver birches the greenness of the foliage contrasting powerfully with the blue of the narrow fiords that opened on every hand and with the colours in which the toylike country houses were painted their timber walls being always snowy white and their shingle roofs a flaming red even some of the village spires wore the same sanguinary hue presenting thus a singular feature in the landscape the rain increased to an unpleasant degree the afternoon seemed to darken into evening and the evening into night sooner than usual while dense masses of vapour came rolling down the steep sides of the wooded hills over which the sombre firs spread everywhere and up every vista that opened like a sea of cones and as the houses became fewer and farther apart and not a single wanderer was abroad and i had but the pocketmap of my john murray to guide me i soon became convinced that instead of pursuing the route to rodnaes i was somewhere on the banks of the tyrifiord at least three norwegian miles ie twentyone english in the opposite direction my little horse worn out the rain still falling in a continual torrent night already at hand and mountain scenery of the most tremendous character everywhere around me i was in an almost circular valley encompassed by a chain of hills which opened before me after leaving a deep chasm that the road enters near a place which i afterwards learned bears the name of krogkleven owing to the steepness of the road and some decay in the harness of my hired carriole the traces parted and then i found myself with the now useless horse and vehicle far from any house homestead or village where i could have the damage repaired or procure shelter the rain still pouring like a sheet of water the thick shaggy and impenetrable woods of norwegian pine towering all about me their shadows rendered all the darker by the unusual gloom of the night to remain quietly in the carriole was unsuitable to a temperament so impatient as mine i drew it aside from the road spread the tarpaulin over my small stock of baggage and the guncase haltered the pony to it and set forth on foot stiff sore and weary in search of succour and though armed only with a norwegian tolknife having no fear of thieves or of molestation following the road on foot in the face of the blinding rain a scotch plaid and oilskin my sole protection now i perceived ere long a side gate and little avenue which indicated my vicinity to some place of abode after proceeding about three hundred yards or so the wood became more open a light appeared before me and i found it to proceed from a window on the ground floor of a little twostoreyed mansion built entirely of wood the sash which was divided in the middle was unbolted and stood partially and most invitingly open and knowing how hospitable the norwegians are without troubling myself to look for the entrance door i stepped over the low sill into the room which was tenantless and looked about for a bellpull forgetting that in that country where there are no mantelpieces it is generally to be found behind the door the floor was of course bare and painted brown a high german stove like a black iron pillar stood in one corner on a stone block the door which evidently communicated with some other apartment was constructed to open in the middle with one of the quaint lever handles peculiar to the country the furniture was all of plain norwegian pine highly varnished a reindeer skin spread on the floor and another over an easychair were the only luxuries and on the table lay the illustret tidende the aftonblat and other papers of that morning with a meerschaum and pouch of tobacco all serving to show that some one had recently quitted the room i had just taken in all these details by a glance when there entered a tall thin man of gentlemanly appearance clad in a rough tweed suit with a scarlet shirt open at the throat a simple but dégagé style of costume which he seemed to wear with a natural grace for it is not every man who can dress thus and still retain an air of distinction pausing he looked at me with some surprise and inquiringly as i began my apologies and explanation in german taler de dansknorsk said he curtly i cannot speak either with fluency but you are welcome however and i shall assist you in the prosecution of your journey meantime here is cognac i am an old soldier and know the comforts of a full canteen and of the indian weed too in a wet bivouac there is a pipe at your service i thanked him and while he gave directions to his servants to go after the carriole and horse proceeded to observe him more closely for something in his voice and eye interested me deeply there was much of brokenhearted melancholysomething that indicated a hidden sorrowin his features which were handsome and very slightly aquiline his face was pale and careworn his hair and moustache though plentiful were perfectly whiteblanched yet he did not seem over forty years of age his eyes were blue but without softness being strangely keen and sad in expression and times there were when a startled look that savoured of fright or pain or insanity or of all mingled came suddenly into them this unpleasant expression tended greatly to neutralize the symmetry of a face that otherwise was evidently a fine one suddenly a light seemed to spread over it as i threw off some of my sodden mufflings and he exclaimed you speak danskija and english too i know have you quite forgotten me herr kaptain he added grasping my hand with kindly energy dont you remember carl holberg of the danish guards the voice was the same as that of the once happy lively and jolly young danish officer whose gaiety of temper and exuberance of spirit made him seem a species of madcap who was wont to give champagne suppers at the klampenborg gardens to great ladies of the court and to ballet girls of the hof theatre with equal liberality to whom many a fair danish girl had lost her heart and who it was said had once the effrontery to commence a flirtation with one of the royal princesses when he was on guard at the amalienborg palace but how was i to reconcile this change the appearance of many years of premature age that had come upon him i remember you perfectly carl said i while we shook hands yet it is so long since we met moreoverexcuse mebut i knew not whether you were in the land of the living the strange expression which i cannot define came over his face as he said with a low sad tone times there are when i know not whether i am of the living or the dead it is twenty years since our happy daystwenty years since i was wounded at the battle of idstedtand it seems as if twere twenty ages old friend i am indeed glad to meet you again yes old you may call me with truth said he with a sad weary smile as he passed his hand tremulously over his whitened locks which i could remember being a rich auburn all reserve was at an end now and we speedily recalled a score and more of past scenes of merriment and pleasure enjoyed togetherprior to the campaign of holsteinin copenhagen that most delightful and gay of all the northern cities and under the influence of memory his now withered face seemed to brighten and some of its former expression stole back again is this your fishing or shooting quarters carl i asked neither it is my permanent abode in this place so ruralso solitary ah you have become a benedicktaken to love in a cottage and so forthyet i dont see any signs of hush for gods sake you know not who hears us he exclaimed as terror came over his face and he withdrew his hand from the table on which it was resting with a nervous suddenness of action that was unaccountable or as if hot iron had touched it whycan we not talk of such things asked i scarcely hereor anywhere to me he said incoherently then fortifying himself with a stiff glass of cognac and foaming seltzer he added you know that my engagement with my cousin marie louise viborg was broken offbeautiful though she was perhaps is still for even twenty years could not destroy her loveliness of feature and brilliance of expressionbut you never knew why i thought you behaved ill to herwere mad in fact a spasm came over his face again he twitched his hand away as if a wasp had stung or something unseen had touched it as he said she was very proud imperious and jealous she resented of course your openly wearing the opal ring which was thrown to you from the palace window by the princess the ringthe ring oh do not speak of that said he in a hollow tone madyes i was madand yet i am not though i have undergone and even now am undergoing that which would break the heart of a holger danske but you shall hear if i can tell it with coherence and without interruption the reason why i fled from society and the worldand for all these twenty miserable years have buried myself in this mountain solitude where the forest overhangs the fiord and where no womans face shall ever smile on mine in short after some reflection and many involuntary sighsand being urged when the determination to unbosom himself waveredcarl holberg related to me a little narrative so singular and wild that but for the sad gravityor intense solemnity of his mannerand the air of perfect conviction that his manner bore with it i should have deemed him utterlymad marie louise and i were to be married as you remember to cure me of all my frolics and expensive habitsthe very day was fixed you were to be the groomsman and had selected a suite of jewels for the bride in the kongens nytorre but the war that broke out in schleswigholstein drew my battalion of the guards to the field whither i went without much regret so far as my fiancée was concerned for sooth to say both of us were somewhat weary of our engagement and were unsuited to each other so we had not been without piques coldnesses and even quarrels till keeping up appearances partook of boredom i was with general krogh when that decisive battle was fought at idstedt between our troops and the germanizing holsteiners under general willisen my battalion of the guards was detached from the right wing with orders to advance from salbro on the holstein rear while the centre was to be attacked pierced and the batteries beyond it carried at the point of the bayonet all of which was brilliantly done but prior to that i was sent with directions to extend my company in skirmishing order among some thickets that covered a knoll which is crowned by a ruined edifice part of an old monastery with a secluded burialground just prior to our opening fire the funeral of a lady of rank apparently passed us and i drew my men aside to make way for the open catafalque on which lay the coffin covered with white flowers and silver coronets while behind it were her female attendants clad in black cloaks in the usual fashion and carrying wreaths of white flowers and immortelles to lay upon the grave desiring these mourners to make all speed lest they might find themselves under a fire of cannon and musketry my company opened at six hundred yards on the holsteiners who were coming on with great spirit we skirmished with them for more than an hour in the long clear twilight of the july evening and gradually but with considerable loss were driving them through the thicket and over the knoll on which the ruins stand when a halfspent bullet whistled through an opening in the mouldering wall and struck me on the back part of the head just below my bearskin cap a thousand stars seemed to flash around me then darkness succeeded i staggered and fell believing myself mortally wounded a pious invocation trembled on my lips the roar of the red and distant battle passed away and i became completely insensible how long i lay thus i know not but when i imagined myself coming back to life and to the world i was in a handsome but rather oldfashioned apartment hung one portion of it with tapestry and the other with rich drapery a subdued light that came i could not discover from where filled it on a buffet lay my sword and my brown bearskin cap of the danish guards i had been borne from the field evidently but when and to where i was extended on a soft fauteuil or couch and my uniform coat was open some one was kindly supporting my heada woman dressed in white like a bride young and so lovely that to attempt any description of her seems futile she was like the fancy portraits one occasionally sees of beautiful girls for she was divine perfectly so as some enthusiasts dream or painters happiest conception a long respiration induced by admiration delight and the pain of my wound escaped me she was so exquisitely fair delicate and pale middlesized and slight yet charmingly round with hands that were perfect and marvellous golden hair that curled in rippling masses about her forehead and shoulders and from amid which her piquante little face peeped forth as from a silken nest never have i forgotten that face nor shall i be permitted to do so while life lasts at least he added with a strange contortion of feature expressive of terror rather than ardour it is ever before my eyes sleeping or waking photographed in my heart and on my brain i strove to rise but she stilled or stayed me by a caressing gesture as a mother would her child while softly her bright beaming eyes smiled into mine with more of tenderness perhaps than love while in her whole air there was much of dignity and selfreliance where am i was my first question with me she answered naïvely is it not enough i kissed her hand and said the bullet i remember struck me down in a place of burial on the salbro roadstrange why strange as i am fond of rambling among graves when in my thoughtful moods among graveswhy she asked they look so peaceful and quiet was she laughing at my unwonted gravity that so strange a light seemed to glitter in her eyes on her teeth and over all her lovely face i kissed her hands again and she left them in mine adoration began to fill my heart and eyes and be faintly murmured on my lips for the great beauty of the girl bewildered and intoxicated me and perhaps i was emboldened by past success in more than one love affair she sought to withdraw her hand saying look not thus i know how lightly you hold the love of one elsewhere of my cousin marie louise oh what of that i never never loved till now and drawing a ring from her finger i slipped my beautiful opal in its place and you love me she whispered yes a thousand times yes but you are a soldierwounded too ah if you should die before we meet again or if you should die ere then said i laughingly diei am already dead to the worldin loving you but living or dead our souls are as one and neither heaven nor the powers beneath shall separate us now i exclaimed as something of melodrama began to mingle with the genuineness of the sudden passion with which she had inspired me she was so impulsive so full of brightness and ardour as compared to the cold proud and calm marie louise i boldly encircled her with my arms then her glorious eyes seemed to fill with the subtle light of love while there was a strange magnetic thrill in her touch and more than all in her kiss carl carl she sighed what you know my name and yours thyra but ask no more there are but three words to express the emotion that possessed mebewilderment intoxication madness i showered kisses on her beautiful eyes on her soft tresses on her lips that met mine half way but this excess of joy together with the pain of my wound began to overpower me a sleep a growing and drowsy torpor against which i struggled in vain stole over me i remember clasping her firm little hand in mine as if to save myself from sinking into oblivion and thenno moreno more on again coming back to consciousness i was alone the sun was rising but had not yet risen the scenery the thickets through which we had skirmished rose dark as the deepest indigo against the ambertinted eastern sky and the last light of the waning moon yet silvered the pools and marshes around the borders of the langsö lake where now eight thousand men the slain of yesterdays battle were lying stark and stiff moist with dew and blood i propped myself on one elbow and looked around me with such wonder that a sickness came over my heart i was again in the cemetery where the bullet had struck me down a little gray owl was whooping and blinking in a recess of the crumbling wall was the drapery of the chamber but the ivy that rustled thereonfor where the lighted buffet stood there was an old square tomb whereon lay my sword and bearskin cap the last rays of the waning moonlight stole through the ruins on a newmade gravethe fancied fauteuil on which i laystrewn with the flowers of yesterday and at its head stood a temporary cross hung with white garlands and wreaths of immortelles another ring was on my finger how but where was she the donor oh what opiumdream or what insanity was this for a time i remained utterly bewildered by the vividness of my recent dream for such i believed it to be but if a dream how came this strange ring with a square emerald stone upon my finger and where was mine perplexed by these thoughts and filled with wonder and regret that the beauty i had seen had no reality i picked my way over the ghostly débris of the battlefield faint feverish and thirsty till at the end of a long avenue of lindens i found shelter in a stately brick mansion which i learned belonged to the count of idstedt a noble on whose hospitalityas he favoured the holsteinersi meant to intrude as little as possible he received me however courteously and kindly i found him in deep mourning and on discovering by chance that i was the officer who had halted the line of skirmishers when the funeral cortège passed on the previous day he thanked me with earnestness adding with a deep sigh that it was the burial of his only daughter half my life seems to have gone with hermy lost darling she was so sweet herr kaptainso gentle and so surpassingly beautifulmy poor thyra who did you say i exclaimed in a voice that sounded strange and unnatural while halfstarting from the sofa on which i had cast myself sick at heart and faint from loss of blood thyra my daughter herr kaptain replied the count too full of sorrow to remark my excitement for this had been the quaint old danish name uttered in my dream see what a child i have lost he added as he drew back a curtain which covered a fulllength portrait and to my growing horror and astonishment i beheld arrayed in white even as i had seen her in my vision the fair girl with the masses of golden hair the beautiful eyes and the piquante smile lighting up her features even on the canvas and i was rooted to the spot this ring herr count i gasped he let the curtain fall from his hand and now a terrible emotion seized him as he almost tore the jewel from my finger my daughters ring he exclaimed it was buried with her yesterdayher grave has been violatedviolated by your infamous troops as he spoke a mist seemed to come over my sight a giddiness made my senses reel then a handthe soft little hand of last night with my opal ring on its third fingercame stealing into mine unseen more than that a kiss from tremulous lips i could not see was pressed on mine as i sank backward and fainted the remainder of my story must be briefly told my soldiering was over my nervous system was too much shattered for further military service on my homeward way to join and be wedded to marie louisea union with whom was intensely repugnant to me nowi pondered deeply over the strange subversion of the laws of nature presented by my adventure or the madness it might be that had come upon me on the day i presented myself to my intended bride and approached to salute her i felt a handthe same handlaid softly on mine starting and trembling i looked around me but saw nothing the grasp was firm i passed my other hand over it and felt the slender fingers and the shapely wrist yet still i saw nothing and marie louise gazed at my motions my pallor doubt and terror with calm but cool indignation i was about to speakto explainto say i know not what when a kiss from lips i could not see sealed mine and with a cry like a scream i broke away from my friends and fled all deemed me mad and spoke with commiseration of my wounded head and when i went abroad in the streets men eyed me with curiosity as one over whom some evil destiny hungas one to whom something terrible had happened and gloomy thoughts were wasting me to a shadow my narrative may seem incredible but this attendant unseen yet palpable is ever by my side and if under any impulse such even as sudden pleasure in meeting you i for a moment forget it the soft and gentle touch of a female hand reminds me of the past and haunts me for a guardian demonif i may use such a termrules my destiny one lovely perhaps as an angel life has no pleasures but only terrors for me now sorrow doubt horror and perpetual dread have sapped the roots of existence for a wild and clamorous fear of what the next moment may bring forth is ever in my heart and when the touch comes my soul seems to die within me you know what haunts me nowgod help me god help me you do not understand all this you would say still less do i but in all the idle or extravagant stories i have read of ghostsstories once my sport and ridicule as the result of vulgar superstition or ignorancethe socalled supernatural visitor was visible to the eye or heard by the ear but the ghost the fiend the invisible thing that is ever by the side of carl holberg is only sensible to the touchit is the unseen but tangible substance of an apparition he had got thus far when he gasped grew livid and passing his right hand over the left about an inch above it with trembling fingers he said it is herehere noweven with you present i feel her hand on mine the clasp is tight and tender and she will never leave me but with life and then this once gay strong and gallant fellow now the wreck of himself in body and in spirit sank forward with his head between his knees sobbing and faint four months afterwards when with my friends i was shooting bears at hammerfest i read in tell norwegian aftenposten that carl holberg had shot himself in bed on christmas eve the bombardiers story some feel by instinct swift as light the presence of the foe whom god ordains in future time to strike the fatal blow aytoun very few persons in this world are unlucky enough to see or to have seen a ghost but we nearly have all met with some one else who had seen something weird or unearthly and now for a little story of my own by which you will find that in my time i have more than once encountered a ghost or that which perhaps was worse than any ghost could be in the christmas before the battle of the alma i bob twyford was a young bombardier of the royal artillery a gcr good conduct ring man mighty proud of that and of my uniform with its yellow lace and rows of brass buttons with the motto ubique quo fas et gloria ducunt and so forth when i went home on a months furlough to see old mother and all my friends at our little village in the weald of kent i was proud too to show them that by the single chevron of bombardier my foot was firmly planted on the first step of the long ladder of promotion happy too that there was one in particular to show it tomy cousin little bessie leybournethough she was a big bessie nowmy sweetheart and my wife that was to be if good promotion came or if i bought my discharge and took to business with some money we expectedmoney that was long long in coming more than once in the beautiful season of autumn had bessie leybourne been the queen of the hoppickers and then i thought that she looked bright and beautiful as a fairy when the crown of flowers was placed on her sunny brown hair and her deep blue eyes were beaming with pleasure and gratified vanity i had a dream about bessie on the night beforea dream that made me uncomfortable and gave me much cause for thought and so a vague presentiment of coming evil clouded the joy of my returning home i had seen bessy in her beauty and her bravery as the hop queen but she was calling on me to protect herfor she was struggling to free herself from the embraces and the blandishments of a handsome and blasélooking man whose costume and bearing were alike fashionable and distinguished close by them looking on evidently with amusement was his friend a hooknosed grim and sombrelooking fellow with a black moustache and malevolent eyes who held me back as with a grasp of iron while uttering a strange chuckling laugh the sound of which awoke me but the faces of those men made a vivid and painful impression upon me for the whole vision seemed so distinct and real that i believed i should recognize them anywhere i spoke to tom inches our scotch paysergeant about it and he being a great believer in dreams assured me that it was ominous of some evil that would certainly happen to bessie or to me or to us both for you must know bob he continued that in sleep the soul seems to issue from the body and to attain the power of looking into the future for time or place distance or space form no obstruction then so the untrammelled spirit of the dreamer may see the future as well as the past and know that which is to happen as well as that which has happened the scotchmans words had a solemnity about them that rendered me still more uneasy but i strove to shake off care and already saw in anticipation my mothers cottage among the woodlands of the weald every pace drew me nearer home and i trod gaily on with my knapsack on my back and only a crown piece in my pocket my purse was light but save for that ugly dream my heart was lighter still as i thought of bessie leybourne i had left the railway station some miles behind it was christmas eve the weald of kent spread before me not as i had seen it last in its summer greenness but covered deep with snow over which the sun as he set shed a purple flush that deepened in the shade to blue and made the icicles on every hedge and tree glitter with a thousand prismatic colours red lights were beginning to twinkle through the leafless copses from cottage windows and heavily the dun winter smoke was curling in the clear mid air from many a house and homestead and from the clustered chimney stalks of the quaint and stately old rectory an emotion of bitterness came over me on passing this edifice with all its gables and lighted oriel windows i had no great love for the rector when a boy i had found in our garden a pheasant which he the rev dr raikes had wounded by a shot pleased with the beauty of the bird i made a household pet of it till his keeper hearing of the circumstance had me arrested and stigmatized as a little poacher the rector as a magistrate being the exponent of the law in the matter so i quitted the parish and its petty tyrant to become a gunner and driver in the artillery where my good education soon proved of service to me for the sake of a miserable bird the sporting rector had driven into the world a widows only son but how fared he in his own household valentine raikes his only son was breaking his proud and pampered heart by mad dissipation by gambling and every species of debauchery by horseracing and by debts of honour which had been paid thrice over to save his commission in the hussars at last i stood by mothers cottage door the little dwelling was smothered among hops and ivy and with these were blended roses and honeysuckle in summer now the icicles hung in rows under the thatched eaves but a red and cheerful glow came through the lozenged panes of the deepset little windows on the waste of snow without a moment i lingered by the gate and in the garden plot for my heart was very full and it wellnigh failed me but there was a listener within who heard my step and knew it and the next moment saw me in my mothers arms and i felt like a boy again as my happy tears mingled with hers and it seemed as if this christmas eve was to be the christmas eve of past and jollier times a merry christmas bob and a happy new year the dear old womans face was bright with joy yet i could detect many a wrinkle now where dimples once had been and see that her hair was thinner and whiter perhaps as she passed her tremulous hand caressingly over my bronzed face as if to assure herself of my identity and that i was really her own boy bob then she helped me off with my knapsack and sat me in fathers old leathern chair by the side of the glowing hearth and pottered about getting me a hot cake and a mug of spiced ale muttering and laughing and hovering about me the while but mother dear said i looking round where is bessie all this time she got my letter of course bessie is across the meadows at the church bob on this cold night mother yes helping miss raikes to decorate it for the service tomorrow miss raikes said i and a cloud came over me i had left headquarters with only four crowns in my pocket we soldiers are seldom overburdened with cashfor though england expects every man to do his duty england likes it done cheapand i had wellnigh starved myself on the road home that i might bring something with me for those i lovedsome gay ribbons for bessie and a lace cap for my mother who was so proud of her bombardier bob for so she always called me heaven bless her i hope she wont be long away mother for ive had such a dream lor bless me bob said she pausing as she bustled about preparing supper a dream have youabout what or whom bessie said i with a sigh as i took the ribbons from my knapsack was it good or evil bob i cant say mother said i with a sickly smile as the solemn words of the scotch paysergeant came back to my memory for an evil dream say we portends good and a pleasant dream portends evil they seem to go by contraries yet somehow by the impression this dream made upon me it seems almost prophetic dont ee say so bob for though in the old testament we find many instances of prophetic dreaming i dont believe in such things nowadays the darkness had set completely in now and i saw that although mother affected to make light of bessies protracted absence she glanced uneasily from time to time through the window and at the old dutch clock that ticked in its corner just as it used to tick when i was a boy and rode on fathers knee for nothing here seemed changed save that mother was older and stooped a trifle more mother dear said i starting up at last i cant stand this delay and bessie must not come through the lanes alone so i shall just step down to the church and escort her home in another moment i was out in the snow a few thick flakes were falling athwart the gloom the decoration of the rectory church for the solemn services of the morrow was i knew of old always considered an important matter in our village yet i could not help thinking that as i had written to announce the very time of my return bessie might have been at home to welcome me instead of that i had now to go in search of her and this was the christmas meetingthe homecoming of which i had drawn so many happy and joyous pictures when alone and in the silence of the night when far away a sentinel on a lonely post or when tossing sleeplessly on the hard wooden guardbed mother was kind loving affectionate as ever but bessie my betrothed why was she absent at such a time the sad presentiment of coming evil grew strong within me and i thought with bitterness of how far i had marched afoot for days and starved myself to buy her gewgaws for i knew that pretty bessie was not without vanity pshaw said i be a man bob twyfordbe a man and leaping the churchyard stile i slowly crossed the burial ground there were lights in the church and i heard the sound of merry voices and even of laughter ringing in its hollow stony space snow covered all the graves and the headstones which stood in close rows a heavy mantle of snow loaded the roof of the church and tipping the carvings of its buttresses brought them out from the mass of the building in strong white relief great icicles depended from the gurgoyles of its tower and battlements and the wind whistled drearily past rustling the masses of ivy that grew over the old saxon apse the tracery of the windows the sturdy old mullions and some heraldic blazons with quaint and ghastly spiritual subjects in stained glass could be discerned by the lights that were within i lifted my foragecap in mute reverence as i passed one grave for i knew my father lay there under a windingsheet of snow and a pace or two more brought me to the quaint little porch of the church where i remained for a time looking in and irresolute whether to advance or retire when my eyes became accustomed to the partial gloom within i could see that the zigzag saxon mouldings and ornaments of the little chancel arch the capitals of the shafts the stairs of the pulpit and the oaken canopy thereof were all decorated with ivy sprigs and holly leaves combined with artificial flowers all with some meaning and taste so as to bring out the architectural features of the quaint old edifice a portable flight of steps stood in the centre of the aisle just under the chancel arch which was low broad massive of no great height and formed a species of frame for a picture that sorely disconcerted me on the summit of that flight stood a lovely laughing young lady whose delicate white hands a little reddened by the winters frost were wreathing scarlet holyberries among the green leaves a little lower down was seated bessiemy own bessieher blue eyes radiant with pleasure her thick hairhalf flaxen half auburnshining like golden threads in the light of the altar lamps that fell on her beaming english face so fresh so fair so charming her lap was full of ivy and holly twigs which a gentleman who hovered near cigar in mouth was cutting and tossing into that receptacle amid much banter and badinage that savoured strongly of familiarity if not of flirtation near them in the background loitered another who was simply leaning against the pillar of the chancel arch looking on with a strange smile and sucking the ivory handle of his cane he laughed as he regarded them that laughwhere had i heard it before in my dream and now the antitypesthe men of my dreamstood before me as yet unnoticed i remained apart and observed them but not unseen for the eyes of the dark man were instantly upon me and the peculiarity of their expression rendered me uneasy he who hovered about bessie was a fairfaced blasélooking young man with sleepy blue eyes a large jaw a receding chin and thick red sensual lips he had long thin flyaway whiskers and a slight moustache with an unmistakably good air about him his companion had that peculiar cast of features which we sometimes see in the polish jewkeen and hawklike with sharp glittering black eyes hair of a raven hue and a general pallor of complexion that seemed bilious sickly and unhealthy i felt instinctively that i hated one and solemnly feared the other why was this was it the result of my dreamof that instinct which like imagination is a word everybody uses and nobody understands perhaps we shall see suddenly the eye of the fairhaired stranger fell on me he adjusted his glass surveyed me leisurely and pausing in the act of playfully holding a sprig of mistletoe over bessies head said in the lisping drawl peculiar to men of his style a soldier by jove now my good manah ahwhat do you want here at this time of night i came to escort my cousin home sir your cousin ehhaw bessie leybourne sir but i added reddening with vexation and annoyance i see she is still busy cousin eh what do you say to this bessie bessie who started from the steps on which she had been seated came towards me also blushing confused and letting fall all the contents of her lap as she held out her hands to me and said welcome home dear bob a merry christmas and a happy new year captain raikes this is my cousin bob who is a soldier like yourselfan artilleryman she added with increasing confusion as if she felt ashamed of my blue jacket among those fine folks while the captain after glancing at me coolly again merely said ohahhawindeed and proceeded to assist his sister in descending the steps as their labours were done and the decorations of the church complete but a heavier cloud came over me now captain raikes was the son of the rector and squire of the parish in right of his mother who was an heiress and he perhaps the wildest and most systematic profligate in all england had made the acquaintance of bessie leybourne a little time they lingered ere bessie curtseyed and bade the young lady goodnight captain raikes whispered something which made bessie blush and glance nervously at me while his friend with the hook nose gave a mocking cough and then we separated they took the path to the gailylighted rectory while bessie and i trod silently back through the snow to my mothers little cottage i pressed bessies hand and arm from time to time and though the pressure was returned i never ventured to touch her cheek or even to speak to her for i felt somehow intuitively that all was over between us and we walked in silence through the lanes where we had been wont to ramble when children it seemed to be always summer in the green lanes then but it was biting winter now i asked for no explanation and none was offered me but i felt that bessie once so loving and playful was now cold reserved and shy next day was christmas our fireplace was decked with green boughs and hollyleaves and huge sprigs of mistletoe i heard the chimes ringing merrily in the old tower of the rectory church it was a clear cold snowy and frosty but hearty old english christmas and faces shone bright hands were shaken and warm wishes expressed among friends and neighbours as we trod through the holly lanes and over the crisp frosty grass to churchmother bessie and i and again as in boyhood i heard our rubicund rector preach against worldly pride and luxury both of which throughout a long life he had enjoyed to the full the dark strangerthe squires constant companion chum and mentor whose strange bearing and wicked ways gained him the sobriquets of pluto and hooknose in the villagewas not with the rectors family on this day and i learned that he resided at the village inn it was evident though we read off the same book that bessies thoughts were neither with heaven nor me for i caught many a glance that was exchanged between captain raikes and her and these showed a secret intelligence i sat out the rectors sermon in silent misery and in misery returned homea moody and discontented fellow wishing myself back at headquarters or anywhere but in the weald of kent bessie didnt seem to care much about my ribbons why should she i was only a poor devil of a bombardier and couldnt give her such rich presents as those pearl drops which i now discovered in her ears a present from captain raikes bob said mother good simple soul but i dont think she should ha shown em till her weddingday i had a mouthful of mothers christmas dumpling in my throat at that moment and it wellnigh choked me the mistletoe hung over our heads but i never claimed the playful privilege it accorded was there not some terrible change when i dared notor scornedto kiss bessie even in jest others kisses had been upon her lips and so they had no longer a charm for me day and night dread and doubt haunted me while hope with her hundred shapes and many hues returned no more brooding silent and melancholy thoughts seemed to consume me yet the time passed slowly and heavily for bessies falsehood and fickleness formed the first recollection in the morning the last at night and the source of many a tantalizing dream between all the ebbs and flows of feeling or emotion which torment the lover i endured my sufferings were very great and from being as jolly hardy and expert a gunner as ever levelled a lancaster or an armstrong i was becoming a very noodlea moonstruck creaturea thoroughbred donkey as tom inches would have called meand all for the love of bessie leybourne short though my time at home would be bessie could give me but little of her society my jealousy would no longer be concealed and that she had secret meetings with our squire i could no more doubt then came tears upbraidings and bitterness with promises that she would meet him no more and in the strongest language i could command i told her of the perils she ran of the desperate character of valentine raikes of his mad orgies and debaucheries of the gambling drinking singing swearing and whooping that accompanied the suppers he and hooknose had almost every night in a lonely lodge of the rectory grounds oh bob dont bother she would say imploringly through her smiles and tears it is terrible to be told constantly that one must marry one particular young man meaning bessie that mother reminds you of being engaged to me well yes you are fickle bessie my poor bob you are not rich neither am i hence your fickleness but oh bessie dont think i want to make a soldiers wife of you i hope for better days and to settle down at home oh bessie my own bessie listen to me and hear me and so she would listen to me and hear me and then slip away to keep a tryst with my rival once or twice bessie became angry with me and ventured to defend the squire laying the blame of all his evil actions on his friend or mentorthe dark mephistopheles who was always by his side her defence of him maddened me from tears she took to taunts and i replied by scorn we separated in hot anger and with my mind a perfect chaosa whirland already repenting my violence or precipitation i strode moodily through the holly lanes till a sudden turn brought me face to face with captain raikes and his dark friend in close and earnest conversation the idea of honest and manly remonstrance seized me and touching my cap respectfully as became me to an officer i said captain raikes may i crave a word with you certainlyhaw he drawled while his friend drew back surveying me with his strange malevolent but terrible smile in what can ihawserve you in a matter sir that lies very near my heart he surveyed me with a quiet but puzzled air through his glass and replied hawhave seen you before how is your pretty cousin bessie leybourne this morningwell i hope it is about bessie i wish to speak sir said i with a gravity that made him start and colour a littlebut only a little as he was one of those solemn selfconceited unimpressionable snobs who disdain to exhibit the slightest emotion he did however become uneasy ultimately and pulled his long whiskers when i said captain raikes my cousin bessie is my betrothed wife and though i am but a poor private soldier or little more i must urge siray requestthat you cease to follow molest or meet her as i have good reason to know you do for though bessie is a truehearted girl no good can come of it so i put it to you sir as a gentlemanas my comrade though our ranks are far apartwhether your intentions can be honourable in the matter by jove the idea ill tell you what it is my good fellah said he twirling his riding whip i have listened to your impertinent adviceyour demmed interference with my movementsso far without laying this across your shoulders but bewarehawhow you address me on this subject again passion and jealousy blinded me and shaking my hand in his face i said captain raikes on your life i charge you not to trifle with her or with me he never lost his selfpossession but said with a smile very good but rather daring in a private soldiera poachera vagabond i heard the strange laugh of hooknose at these words and while it was ringing in my ears i struck the squire to the earth and he lay as still as if a twelvepound shot had finished him then i walked deliberately away i had vague alarms now he might have me arrested on a charge of assault or might report me to headquarters for the blow although he was not in uniform but he did neither as he left the weald that night for london and mother and i sat gazing at each other in alarm and griefour bessie had disappeared by some of our neighbours she had been seen near the branch station of the southeastern line with valentine raikes and his mysterious friend the hooknose and from that hour all trace of her waslost      she had left me coldly and heartlessly and old mother too who had always been more than a mother to her so passed the last christmas i was to spend in old england i got over it in time i was not without hope that i might discover bessie and befriend her yetay even yet but i couldnt do much being only a poor fellow with two shillings per diem and an extra penny for beer and pipeclay but even that hope was crushed when in the following august i was ordered with the siege train to sebastopol and sailed from southampton aboard the balmoral of hull a transport ship which had on board a whole battery of artillery with one hundred and ten fine horses captain raikes was i knew with the light cavalry brigade under lord cardigan and i only prayed that heaven and the chances of war would keep us apart and not put the terrible temptation before me of seeing him under fire our voyage was prosperous till we entered the black sea when we experienced heavy gales of wind and lost our topmasts and as the gales increased in fury and steadiness they were blowing a perfect hurricane on the night when in this crippled condition we hauled up for the harbour of balaclava were i to live a thousand years i should never forget the horrors and certain events of that night and though the perils that our transport encountered were ably described by more than one newspaper correspondent i shall venture to recall them here wearied with hard stable duty i had fallen asleep in my birth when i was suddenly roused by a voicethe voice of bessie bob bob dearest bobsave me save me i am drowning it rang distinctly in my ears and then i seemed to hear the gurgling of water as i sprang from bed in terror and bewilderment and from no dream that i was at all conscious of but i had little time to think of the matter for now the bugle sounded down the hatchway to change the watch on deck the night was pitchy dark all our compasses had suddenly become uselessno two needles pointed the same wayand the rudder bands were rent by the force of the sea which tore in vast volume over the deck sweeping everything that was loose away the watch were all lashed to belaying pins or the lower rattlins but three of ours and two seamen were swept overboard and drowned to add to our dangers as we lifted towards the harbour mouth the balmoral heeled over so much that the ballast broke loose in the hold and uprooted the stable deck the centre of gravity was thus lost and the transport lay almost over on her beamends with the wild sea breaking over her as she went like a helpless log on some rocks within the harbour entrance the captain commanding the artillery ordered tom inches and a party of whom i was one into the hold or stables to see how the horses fared and i shall never forget that terrific scene for it nearly rendered me oblivious of the cry that yet lingered in my ears the time was exactly midnight and i almost fear to be considered a visionary by relating all that followed the vessel lay nearly on her beamends to starboard the whole of the stalls on the port side had given way and the horses were lying over each other in piles many of them half or wholly strangled in their halters and there in the dark they were biting and tearing each other with their teeth neighing snorting and even screaming a dreadful sound is a horses scream and kicking each other to death the atmosphere was stifling the wounds they gave each other were bloody and frightful many had their legs and ribs broken and others their eyes dashed out by ironed hoofs above were the bellowing of the wind and the roaring of the black sea on the rocks of balaclava there were even thunderpeals at times to add to the terrors of the occasion and the rain was falling on the deck like a vast sheet of water many of our men were severely wounded by kicks for the horses that survived were wild with fearmaddened in factand in their present condition proved quite unmanageable carrying a lantern i was making my way into the hold and through this frightful scene when suddenly amid it all and through the gloom i saw a face that terrifiedthat fascinatedme but which none of my comrades could see was i mad or about to become so within six inches of my own face was the keen dark and swarthythe almost blackvisage of hooknose glaring at me mocking and jibbering his eyes shining like two carbuncles his sharp teeth glistening with his old malevolent smile and as i shrank back i heard his mocking laughthe same laugh that had tingled in my ears on that fatal christmas time at home i fell over a horse the hoof of another struck me on the chest i became insensible and on recovering found myself on deck in the hands of tom inches and the surgeon i was soon fit for duty luckily as that ship was no place for a sick man with sunrise the storm abated with slings the horses were hoisted out as fast as we could bring them and of the hundred and ten we had on board we found that ninetyfive had been kicked to death smothered or so bruised that we were compelled to shoot them with our carbines their carcasses lay long in balaclava harbour where they were used as stepping stones by the sailors and boatmen till their corruption filled the air adding to the cholera and fever in the town and camp all that haunted me must have been fancy thought i for my thoughts were always running on bessielost to me and to the worldfevered fancy especially the cry and the horrid gurgling as of a drowning person that followed it the sound of the sea must have produced or suggested the cry in my sleeping ear and the subsequent vision in the holdthose gleaming eyes and that fierce hooked nose and yet as an author has remarked the whole world of nature is but one vast book of symbols which we cannot decipher because we have lost the key it was ungrateful of me to be always thinking of bessie who had scorned flouted and deserted methinking more of her than of poor old mother in the weald of kent who loved me with all her soul as only a mother could love a son who was amid the trenches of sebastopol but i couldnt help it for the terrible mystery that involved the fate of bessie made me brood over it at all times as for the trifle of money i had expected it never came and now i didnt want it it was christmas eve before sebastopol as it was all over gods christian world but i hope never again to see such a ghastly festival i was not at the breaching batteries that night having been sent with two horses and four men to bring in a twelve pound gun which had been left by the russians in the valley of inkermann after the battle of the 5th of november tom inches and many a brave fellow of ours had gone to their long home in that valley of death and i was a batterysergeant now the cold was awful and we were rendered very feeble by hunger toil and halfhealed wounds so like men in a dream we traced the horses to the gun and limbered up the tumbril both of which lay among some ruins in rear of the british right attack and not far from the frozen tchernay three miles distant rose sebastopol and the sky seemed all on fire in and around it for they were keeping christmas night amid shot from our lancaster guns and whistling dicks of all sorts and sizes from handgrenades to eighteeninch bombs chokeful of nails broken bottles and grapeshot yet i couldnt help thinking of home and how merrily the village chimes would be ringing in the old tower of the rectory church amid the hopgardens and the cherrygroves of kent and then i saw in fancy the old fireside where fathers leathern chair was empty now and where one at least would say her prayers that night for methat happy night at home when every church and hearth would be gay with ivy leaves and hollyberries and the lads and the lasses would be dancing under the mistletoe and with all these came thoughts of christmas geese and plumpuddings and i drew my swordbelt in a hole or two for i was starvinglightheaded and giddy with want and as we rode silently on the swinging chains of the gun seemed to me like the jangle of our village chimes but they rung over the snowy waste that lay between khutor mackenzie and the highland campa white waste dotted by many a dead man and horse as we rode silently on man after man of our little party of four gave in dropped from the gun to which i had no means of securing them overcome by cold fatigue and death at last i was riding alone in the saddle with the gun rattling behind me ghastly sights were around me on that christmas night and the glinting of the moon at times made them more ghastly still on french mule litters and on horses many wounded and dying men were being borne from the redoubts down to balaclava and as my progress was very slow with two wornout halfstarved nags a terrible procession passed before me many of the poor fellows were nearly over their troubles and sorrows with closed eyes relaxed jaws and hollow visages they were carried down the snowy path by the ambulance corps and the pale steam that curled in the frosty air from the lips of each alone indicated that they breathed two dismounted hussarsfor amid their rags i discovered them to be suchwere carrying one who seemed like a veritable corpse strapped upright on a seat the legs dangled the eyes were staring open and glassy and the head nodded to and fro comrades said i that poor fellow is surely out of pain now not yet said one he is an officer of ours badly wounded and frostbitten an officer captain raikes he wont last till morning i fear raikes said i through my clenched teeth valentine raikesand here ay here sure enough said the hussar my heart bounded and then stood still for a moment at last i said place him on the gun comrades and i will take him on to balaclava but first here ive some raki in my canteen give him a mouthful if he can swallow raikes was placed on the seat of the guncarriage buckled thereto with straps and muffled up as well as we could devise to protect him from the cold the two hussars left me and then we were alone he and ivalentine raikes and bob twyfordin the solitary valley through which the road wound that led to balaclava though coarse and fiery the raki partially revived the sinking man and leaving my saddle i asked him in a voice husky with cold and emotion if he knew me but he shook his head sadly and listlessly and bearded as i was then it was no wonder that his dimmed vision failed to recognize me i am robert twyford the bombardier whose plighted wife you stole valentine raikes god judge between you and me but i feel that i must forgive you now my winding sheet is woven in the loom of hell he moaned in a low and almost inarticulate voice oh twyford i have wronged youand herandmany many more but bessie said i drawing near and propping him in my arms what came of bessie leybourne speaktell me for mercys sake while you have the power ask the watersthe waters wherewhere under blackfriarsbridge she perished there on the 27th of last september the 27th was the night of the stormthe night of the mysterious drowning cry which startled me from sleep i am sinking fast twyford he resumed in a hollow and broken voice pray for mepray for me there is but one way to heaven but many to perdition added a strange deep voice and a dark indistinct and muffled figure having two gleaming eyes stood by the wheel of the guncarriage just as a cloud overspread the moon herehe here do not let him touch medo not let himtouch me cried raikes in a voice that rose into a scream of despair as he threw up his arms and fell back there was a gurgle in his throat and all was over a fiendish chuckling laugh seemed to pass me on the skirt of the frosty wind but i saw no one nor had i time to observe or to remember much more for now a madness seemed to seize the horses they dashed away with frightful speed the fieldpiece swinging like a toy at their hoofs it swept over me breaking one of my legs and inflicting also a terrible wound on the head i sank among the snow and remember no more of that night for after weeks of delirium and fever i found myself a poor weak and emaciated inmate of the hospital at scutari and so far on my way home to dear old england but such was the christmas night i spent before sebastopol and such were those mysteries in the book of nature to which i can find as yet no key kotah a tale of the indian mutiny it was on a soft and warm night in april that we were encamped not far from the margin of lake erie in expectation of the fenian raiders who were having armed picnics and threatening a plundering invasion of upper canada we were simply an advanced post consisting of my company of the royal canadian rifle regiment and some two hundred volunteers farmers and their sons for some time past there had been considerable alarm along the canadian frontier general mead of the united states army was at eastport with his staff and the federal gunboat winooske was cruising off that place on the lookout for an alleged fenian vessel numerous armed meetings had taken place in the state of maine and a great embarkation of the brotherhood in green was expected to take place at ogdensburg the capital of st lawrence which has a safe and commodious harbour but luckily the whole affair ended in bluster and rumour the only fire we saw was that of our bivouac and the only smoke that of the soothing weed while we sat by the wolfscaring faggot and drank from our canteens of rumandwater singing songs and telling stories to wile the night away the picturesque was not wanting in the group around that blazing fire of pine wood the royal canadians in their dark green tunics faced with scarlet the volunteers in orthodox red coats or fringed huntingshirts with white belts worn over them were all bronzed rough and bearded fellows hardy by nature and resolute in bearing led in most instances by old queens officers who had commuted their commissions and turned their swords into ploughshares on farms by the banks of the new niagara or the shores of the vast erie whose waters stretched in darkness far away towards the hills of pennsylvania come captain tell us a story of other lands and sharper work than this said one of the canadian volunteers as he proffered me his tobaccopouch which was prettily embroidered with wampum tell us something about the mutiny in india you served there as we all know yes said i as the memory of other times and other facesfaces i should never look upon in this world againcame over me i served there in the th dragoons and can relate a strange story indeedof discipline overdoneof that which we hear little about in our service thank heaventyranny and of a young hero who without a crime was sentenced to die the death of a felon we know said one of my subs that the mutiny is always a bitter subject with you i lost much by the destruction of indian property and so had to begin the slidingscale what kind of scale is that sloping from the cavalry to the line but the story captain urged the volunteers well here goes said i and after a pause and a sip at the canteen began thus the narrative i am about to tell you was not one in which i figured much personally save as member of a courtmartial but it details suffering with which i was familiarthe miserable fate of sergeant anthony ernslie a fine old soldier and his son philip a brave young fellowa mere ladboth of whom were in my troop during the crimean war and afterwards in the memorable mutiny the horrors of which are so fresh in the minds of all i had not been long with the regiment before i discovered that a deeplyrooted enmity existed between our sergeantmajor matthew pivett and my troopsergeant ernslie and that it had been one of long standing having originated in jealousy when both were privates quartered at canterbury and both were rivals for the affection of a pretty milliner girl she however preferred ernslie then a horse artilleryman but when our corps was under orders to join the army of the east ernslie volunteered for general service in the cavalry and by the chance of fate was placed in my troop of the th dragoons where his steady conduct fine appearance and strict attention to duty soon caused me to recommend him for promotion and he gained his third stripe with a rapidity that did not fail to excite the remark of the envious yet his life was rendered miserable by the sergeantmajora stern wiry sharpeyed loudvoiced and vindictive man and more than once when i interposed my authority to keep peace between them has ernslie told me with tears in his eyes that he cursed the day on which he left the ranks of the horse artillery to become a dragoon a senior when perpetually on the watch to worry a junior may easily find opportunities enough for doing so thus ernslies belts were never pipeclayed quite to the taste of pivett and at the staff inspection before parade faults were ever found with his horse harness and everything he was put on duty at times out of his turn and not in accordance with the roster a complaint to the adjutant or myself always altered these errors but the sting of annoyance remained at drill a hundred petty faults were found with him and he was perpetually accused of taking up wrong dressings distances and alignments till in his anger and bewilderment the poor man sometimes really did so and then great was the delight of pivett for what said he one day bitterly for what did i ever leave my old regiment no good most likely sneered pivett sir i won my three goodconduct rings there by a fluke of course replied pivett adding in a loud voice silence to check the rising retort of the other as shakespeare has it that in the captains but a choleric word which in the soldier is rank blasphemy and so it came to pass that whenever ernslie ventured to remonstrate his oppressor invariably sent him to his room under arrest and twicea great insult to a sergeantto the guardhouse but though the charges of mutiny and insubordination were always quashed by the colonel poor ernslie felt as he told me that he was a doomed man and safe to come to grief some day for the sergeantmajor had sworn an oath to smash him his son philip a private in the troop saw and felt all this the lads smothered hatred and fear of the sergeantmajor were great but he did his duty well and steadily and contrived to elude notice ernslie was proud of his handsome boy and thanked heaven in the inmost recesses of his heart when the war was over in the crimea for there father and son had ridden side by side in the famous charge of the heavy brigade and both had escaped almost scatheless but when we were ordered to india to stem with our swords the great tide of the terrible mutiny the fathers anxieties were revived again when our transport was off the cape de verd islands ernslie came to my cabin in great distress to announce that his wife had just died i knew that the poor woman had been ailing for some time past and the sickness incident to the rough weather we encountered put an end to her sufferings and she died in the arms of her son for her husband was with his watch on deck and the sergeantmajor would not permit him to go below she had died at daybreak and by noon that day the body swathed in her bedding and lashed round with spunyarn lay on a grating to leeward with a twentypound shot at the feet and a union jack spread over it by sound of trumpet our men fell into their ranks and like the sailors all stood bareheaded silent and grave for a funeral at sea is the most sad and solemn of all there was a heavy breeze at the time and the ship was flying before it with her courses and headsails only and the bitter spray swept over us in drenching showers the adjutant read the burial service at a given signal the grating was lifted and the body vanished with a splash under the ships counter close by me stood sergeant ernslie and his son clutching the mizen shrouds with one hand and philip by the other he bent his pale face over the quarter as if to give a farewell glance at the corpse but it was gonegone for ever ernslie was barely forty but now he looked quite old and haggard and his hair was streaked with gray he saw pivett standing near him as the men were dismissed and passing forward or below and as if he felt and knew that the original cause of enmity had passed away he held forth his hand and said in a choking voice for grief had softened his heart youll shake hands with me now sergeantmajor wont you but matthew pivett answered only by a scowl and crossed to the windward side of the deck so even by the side of that vast and uncouth grave their hatred was not quenched and i had twice to interfere for ernslies protection before our transport ran up the hooghly and landed us at calcutta from whence the river steamers took us up country to allahabad where our remount awaited us and we took the field at once under brigadiergeneral r if ernslies tormentor spared his son it must have been through some lingering regard for the dead mother or some soft memory of the love he once bore her and ernslie was thankful that philip escaped for the lad was passionate and resentful and had vowed to his father in secret that he would yet serve out the sergeantmajor one morning long before daybreak we were on the march towards the province of ajmir where a noted rebel hossein ali was at the head of a great force we had endured the most unparalleled heat for days the sky had been as a sheet of heated brass above our heads and the cracked and baked earth as molten iron under foot cases of sunstroke had been incessant and many of our horses perished on the march on this morning our thirst was excessive for the tanks of a temple on which we had relied for water had become dry in the night and the bheesties or watercarriers attached to the regiment had deserted to hossein ali and most of us were without liquid of any kind in our canteens among others situated thus was sergeant ernslie who had been on patrol duty until the last moment his son philip was the orderly of the colonel and while that officers horse was getting a drink he had contrived to fill his canteen from the bucket and held it invitingly to ernslie just as the corps filed past for the colonel had not yet mounted agonized as he was with thirst to resist the temptation was impossible so ernslie galloped to where his son stood a hundred yards distant or so near the hut of palmleaves which had formed the colonels quarters to your troop sergeant ernslie back to your troop sir cried the sergeantmajor in a voice of thunder ernslie heard the voice of his enemy but still rode towards his son and took a long draught from his canteen before turning his horse and galloping back to his troop how dare you leave the ranks when on the line of march resumed pivett heedless in his fury that this was interfering with me fall in with the quarter guard he added in his most bullying tone and consider yourself under arrest i shall do neither one nor the other replied ernslie trembling with passion i am under the orders of the captain of the troopnot yours keep your own place or by heaven i shall make you and in his just anger ernslie was rash enough to shake his sword with the point towards pivettan unmistakable threat so the colonel was compelled to place him under arrest in the face of the whole regiment at last you have fixed me sergeantmajor said he calmly but bitterly as he sheathed his sword and turned to the rear but if you look for your true character you will find it in the military dictionary likely enough but under what head discipline no tyrant see how that is defined the sergeantmajor did look and saw that colonel james therein defines petty tyrantsa low grovelling set of beings who without one spark of real courage within themselves execute the orders of usurped or strained authority with brutal rigour and as he read on pivett grew pale with rage at the first halt of the brigade a general courtmartial of which i was the junior member sat by order of general r an example was wanted so ernslie was reduced to the ranks our parade next morning was a gloomy one as we formed a hollow square of close columns of regiments near the ruins of a great hindoo temple the sun was yet below the horizon and in the dim cold light the face of ernslie looked pale and ghastly as he was marched into the square a prisoner between two armed troopers one of whom with execrable taste the sergeantmajor had contrived should be his own son philip the sergeant was nervous in bearing and restless in eye but his mind seemed to be turned inward he was thinking perhaps of the terrors of the day at balaclava of the dead wife he had committed to the deep or of the boy who stood scheming revenge by his side but it was not until he felt the penknife of the trumpetmajor ripping the worthilywon chevrons from his sleeve that a groan escaped his lips a flush crossed his haggard face and his soul seemed to die within him then he slunk to the rear of his troop a broken and degraded man philips dark eyes were full of fire and if a glance could have slain the career of matthew pivett had ended there we all felt for the sergeant and knew that in the vindication of discipline he had been made a victim but that night the queen lost a good soldier for ernslie was absent from rollcallhe had disappeared without a trace and the sergeantmajor openly declared his belief that he had deserted to the rebel sepoys under hossein ali the truth was though we knew it not at the time that ernslie when wandering alone and unarmed near our camp communing with himself in a storm of grief and misery had actually been waylaid and carried off by some of hosseins scouting sepoys who by that time were tired of slaughtering and torturing the white feringhees they spared him and discovering somehow that he had once been a golandazee or gunner they chained him naked to a fieldpiece and kept him to assist in working their cannon against us in kotah the place which we were on the march to besiege and storm so poor anthony ernslies name was further disgraced by being scored down as a deserter in the regimental books the forces which we accompanied under general r consisted of the 8th royal irish hussars hm 72nd highlanders 83rd and 95th regiments together with the 13th bengal native infantry a corps which had not yet revolted but was sorely mistrusted the enemy in kotah consisted entirely of mutineers but chiefly those of the 72nd bengal infantry whose scarlet coats were faced with yellow exactly like those of the 72nd highlanders now advancing against them and we considered it a curious coincidence that two regiments bearing the same number should meet in mortal conflict our march was a severe one each of our horses had not less than twenty stone weight to carry irrespective of forage and yet there was not a sore back or a broken girth either in our ranks or in those of the 8th hussars when after traversing a mountainous but fertile and wellwatered district we came in sight of kotah which had been the seat of a rajpootrajah on the east bank of the chumbul it is a large town girt by massive walls defended by bastions and deep ditches cut out of the solid rock its entrances were all protected by double gateways both strong and stately looked the fortified town when under the scorching blaze of an indian sun and a hot red sky amid which the hungry vultures floated we saw it and the palace of the rajah with all its lofty white turrets the roofs of bazaars and temples crowning a steep slope that was covered by teak tamarind and date palm trees all of lovely green in the foreground lay a vast lake with the superb temple of jugmandul a mass of snowwhite marble rising in its centre its peristyles and domes reflected downward in the deep and darkblue water the rajah had fled in his palace hossein ali an exkotehavildar or paysergeant of the revolted 72nd bni reigned supreme and its marble courts and chambers were yet stained by the blood of our women children and other defenceless people who had been slain therein after enduring indignities and torments that maddened those who came like us to avenge them and full of the memories of those deeds with the other horrors of cawnpore and delhi to inflame us we pushed the siege with relentless vigour though hosseins men with seventy pieces of cannon gave us quite enough to do and our sappers worked in vain to undermine the enormous walls night and day amid slaughter wounds sunstroke and cholera we pounded away at each other with the big guns officers and men worked side by side at them and in the trenches aiding or covering the sappers in their scheme of a mine till we were all as black as the pandies with gunpowder dust and grime and till the once gay uniform of ours had given place to flannel jerseys and rags our helmets to linen puggerees or solarhats our pantaloons to cotton knickerbockers and cawnpore boots and even those who had been the greatest dandies among us were seldom seen without a scrubby beard a shovel a revolver and chinshura cheroot in short we were more like diggers or desperadoes than her britannic majestys dragoons with a working party composed of men of various corps one morning before daybreak i was assisting the sappers at the mine while the enemy with shot shell and rockets did all they could to retard or dislodge us it was a horrid place i remember encumbered by dead camels and horsesyea and men too in every stage of decomposition where the gorged vultures hovered lazily among fallen ruins and whitening bones jack sepoy thinks it no sin now to bite the greased cartridgethe scoundrel said one of my men as a bullet broke the shovel in his hand sinas little as to cut the throats of our wives and children in cold blood added another with a fierce oath fighting for glory is a fine thing said young philip ernslie resting on his pickaxe but fighting for a shilling per day with a penny extra for beer is a different affair but we are fighting for revenge phil said a soldier whose wife and children had perished at meerut true replied ernslie through his clenched teeth and times there are by jove when even revenge may be just and holy silence growled sergeantmajor pivett still in pursuance of his feud down mendown cried i for here comes a shell humming through the air but oddly enough not whistling a teninch shell fell near me and with a thud half sunk into the soil strange to say it was without a fuze the touchhole was simply plugged by a common cork in which a halfscorched quillpen was stuck after lying flat on our faces and watching it uneasily for some time and all fearing a snare or the explosion of some poisonous stuff i ventured to roll it over with a shovel and found that it was empty or quite unloaded pivett who certainly did not lack courage sprang forward and extracting the cork from the fuzehole found a scrap of paper attached to it and on the scrap was written with ink that seemed to have been composed of gunpowder and water these words i am a prisoner in kotah the work of the sappers is useless for where they are mining the rock is solid there are seventy guns in this place and i am chained to one of the seventeen in the right bastion if the front gate is blown up the place may be carried at the point of the bayonet as the way beyond is quite open a ernslie private hm th dragoons i knew that fellow had deserted to the enemy growled the sergeantmajor silence said i and do not be unjust in your hatred its a messageshell sir a messageshell and fired by my father poor man heaven help himhe is in the hands of the sepoys exclaimed young ernslie whom with the shell and note i took at once to the general whose tent was by the margin of the lake this information caused the staff at once to abandon the idea of a mine and all our energies were now bent against the great gate though the junior regiment of the division the 72nd or duke of albanys own highlanders were ordered to furnish three hundred men for a storming party and at two oclock on the morning of the 30th of march the grand assault was to be made while wethe cavalrywere in our saddles to cover and if possible assist in the attack when the great gate was forced my brave lads rouse i heard the adjutant of the highlanders cry in the dark quit your dogs sleephalfdozing and halfwakingand fall in fall in stormers and while the warning pipes blew loud and shrill cheerfully they formed by companies those brave albany highlanders and stately indeed looked their grenadiers with their tall plumed bonnets and royal stuart tartan for the highland regiments during the mutiny had not time to adopt indian clothing and went at the pandies in their kilts and ostrich feathers just as their forefathers did at madras and assaye silently they crossed the river in the dark where the graceful date palms and the luxuriant mango topes cast a deeper shadow than the starry night upon the water then quitting their boats they crept close to the great outer wall of kotah but so great was the delay in blowing up the gate that day broke the highlanders were seen and for hours we sat in our saddles helplessly and saw the enemy pouring shot and shell upon them from the same bastion where we knew poor tony ernslie was chained to a gun suddenly there was a dreadful shock the wall of the city seemed to open as it rent and gaped a blinding cloud of dust and stones ascended into the air and a shower of wooden splinters the fragments of the great gate flew far and wide as our mine blew the barrier up a mingled shout of scotland for ever the old waterloo warcry of the black watch and the greys broke from the highlanders again and again as they rushed in with fixed bayonets driving back the terrified sepoys storming bastion after bastion and capturing two standards the other regiments broke in at different points and after much hard fighting kotah was ours and then we rode through the streets cutting down the fugitive rebels on right and left  see scotsman of 28th of may 1858 philip ernslie and a few of his comrades made straight for the bastion indicated in his fathers note it was deserted by all save a few dead or dying sepoys but a more terrible spectacle awaited the searchers stripped nude and nailed to the wall of the bastion by the hands and feet hung the body of anthony ernslie minus nose and ears and otherwise horribly mutilated even this appalling spectacle failed to excite the pity or soothe the hate of the malevolent matthew pivett but we were well used to scenes of horror and barbarity during the mutiny for he audibly expressed a conviction that ernslie had met his just reward for deserting to the enemy i shall make you eat your words before the going down of the sun by the god who made us i shall said philip ernslie in a low husky voice heard only by the sergeantmajor who shrunk back so impressed was he by the fierce and resolute aspect of the lad by the deep concentrated loathing that glared in his eyes making his lips ashy pale and causing every muscle to quiver but this emotion was unseen by others and his threat was unheard luckily for if pivett could have found a witness he would at once have made young ernslie prisoner on a charge of insubordination as he really dreaded his vengeance about dark that evening the sergeantmajor was returning from the bungalow of the colonel where with the adjutant he had been preparing lists of casualties and for our march on the morrow when we and the 8th hussars were to surround a village that was full of fugitive mutineers the day had been one of toil of strife and heat now the atmosphere was steamy and moist and pivett was enjoying by anticipation the comforts of a hearty supper and a cool sleep in his tent the sides of which his tattywetter had no doubt soused well with cold water to reach the cavalry camp he had to pass through a ravine not far from the town walla narrow place full of prickly and thorny shrubs where the beautiful silky jungle grass grew in such wild luxuriance that in some instances it was almost breasthigh and where the perfume of the many aromatic plants came floating on the puffs of warm air traversing the narrow path on foot with his sword under his arm he was suddenly confronted in the dusk by philip ernslie who resolutely barred the way he too had his sword by his side but in each hand he had a holster pistol his features were pale as those of a corpse and might have passed for such but for the nervous twitching of his lips as he spoke you know matthew pivett for what purpose i am here mutiny and murder likely enough replied pivett who was a stern and resolute man give up those pistolsfall back and return to your quarters or i shall cut you down draw your sword but one inch from its sheath and i shall send a bullet through your brain replied philip cocking one of the pistols you maddened my poor father by your systematic tyranny for years you had him reduced and degraded and driven desperate from among us you wronged his memory this morning and taunted even his mutilated remains scoundrel what then would you dare to murder me exclaimed the undaunted sergeantmajor no you shall have a chance for your life oh matthew pivett i have long looked for an opportunity like this when i might meet you face to face so take your choice of these pistols for by the heaven that hears us you or i must lie dead here tonight as philip spoke solemnly and sternly with clenched teeth and flashing eyes he thrust a pistol into pivetts hand quarter guard shouted pivett as he made a resolute attempt to grasp the throat of ernslie who thrust him back with the barrel of the other pistol crying stand back sergeantmajor and keep your distance or i shall shoot you down like the dog you are pivett who now saw there was no resource but to fight withdrew a pace or two and fired straight at ernslies head the ball whistled through the white puggeree or cap and slightly grazed his left ear he gave a ghastly smile and said you were rather quick sergeantmajor but now it is my turn he levelled his pistol with a deadly triumphant and vindictive aim straight at the glaring eyes of the agitated pivett but the percussion cap must have been defectiveit snapped and hung fire seize this mutinous rascal cried the sergeantmajor to a patrol who on hearing the explosion of the first pistol came galloping up and philip was instantly made prisoner by a party of the 8th hussars who had seen the whole situation another courtmartial sat by break of day in the palace of the rajah of kotah and wan and haggard after a sleepless night fettered by handcuffs and looking the picture of misery philip ernslie stood before it charged with violating the fortyfirst clause of the second section of the articles of war which ordain that any officer or soldier who shall strike a superior or use any violence against him shall if an officer suffer death and if a soldier death transportation or such other punishment as by a general courtmartial shall be awarded the majority of the members of the court were strangers to the lad and his story and the fathers alleged spirit of insubordination manifested when on the march to kotah was now brought forward in the prosecution of the son the court was but an epitome of the greater world where accusation is condemnation nothing is so fallible as human judgment but nothing so pitiless as captain of philips troop i gave evidence of all i knew and of the good characters borne by father and son but after the brief proceedings terminated and the court was cleared for the consideration of the verdict and sentence i knew too well what they would of necessity be that evening the chaplain visited the prisoner who was confined in one of the vaults of the palace to announce that on the following morning he was todie he spent nearly the whole night with the poor lad who was quite resigned and so calm and prepared for his fate that he begged to be left alone for a little sleep before the appointed time and when the provostmarshal came at gunfire he found philip ernslie in a profound slumber with a horsecloak spread over him and his head resting on a bundle of straw never did we parade with more reluctance than on that 31st of march at dawn and all the corps in and about kotah with some others that had marched in during the night got under arms to witness the execution it was a lovely indian morning the beams of the sun shone redly on the white marble domes and carved minarets of kotah and on the turrets of the rajahs stately palace the place where we paraded was a hollow between two hills that were covered with beautiful groves of the peepulpalm and teakwood and flocks of wild peacocks and green paroquets flew hither and thither as we were massed in columns round the spot where an open grave was yawning and where the guard of the provostmarshaltwelve men and a sergeantstood with their rifles loaded every face was expressive of intense anxiety to have the whole affair over and many were very pale accompanied by the chaplain of the cavalry brigade who wore a surplice over his black uniform surtout and praying very devoutly with his fettered hands clasped before him philip ernslie guarded by an escort came slowly into the square of regiments and stopped midway between the firing party and that premature grave that was so soon to receive him his face was frightfully pale he looked at that black hole which yawned so horribly amid the green turf calmly and steadily and something of a smilebut not of bravado or derisionstole over his features my heart bled for the poor lad but i was immensely relieved when our colonel said in a whisper as he passed me the adjutantgeneral has a reprieve from general r in his pocket so there will be no execution thank heaven i exclaimed fervently we are but acting out a solemn farce for the sake of effect and discipline exactly and the sentence colonel will be commuted to transportation for life it was a human existence blighted for ever any way but now i could look on with more composure the fetters were removed from philips hands he was ordered to take off his cap and listen respectfully to the sentence of the court and he seemed to do so mechanically as one in a dream the proceedings of the tribunal were briefly noted the enormity of the crime forcibly adverted to and then came the doomthat he was to be shot to death the young mans usually haughty and handsome face was wistful and sad in expression now he merely bowed his head in meek assent and in a weak voice asked leave to shake hands with me and some of his comrades they came forth from the ranks as he named them and wrung his cold and clammy fingers in silence and i could see that the eyes of these men were moist with tears yet they were brave fellows all and had charged by my side at inkermann and balaclava philip next asked for the sergeantmajor that he might shake hands even with him and so die at peace with all mankind but pivett was absent from parade that morning and lay seriously ill in his tent for asiatic cholera had fastened upon him philip then turned to the chaplain to signify that he was ready and kneeling near his grave had his eyes covered by a handkerchief the whole scene was now worked up to its utmost intensity and many officers who knew not of the reprieve had taken off their caps to utter a silent prayer for the spirit that was so soon to appear before its maker the silence was profound and we heard only the chumbal rushing on its course to meet the jumna till the voice of the provostmarshal rang in the air firingpartyready and softly the rifles were cocked as you were cried the adjutantgeneral with a bright expression of face halfcock and order arms prisoner stand up you are i rejoice to say mercifully reprieved philip ernslie did not hear the words apparently for his head sank forward on his breast the provostmarshal took his hand to assist him to rise but the poor lad fell forward on his face deadstone deadwithout a wound the sudden revulsion of feeling had killed him so he was actually buried in that unconsecrated ground beneath the shadow of the walls of kotah but ere we marched next day another grave was formed beside him it contained the remains of sergeantmajor pivett and during a long career of service i have met with few events which created so profound a sensation among the troops as this little tragedy the story of raphael velda on an evening in the september of 1860 some excitement was caused among the inhabitants of the secluded town of oppido in calabria ultra when the gleam of arms announced the approach of regular troops the dealers in pottery and silk in wine and oil and the manufacturers of gloves and stockings from the delicate filaments of the shellfish named the pinna marina and the watercarrier by the well conferred together on this unusual circumstance the wandering pifferari paused in their strains before the shrine of the madonna and the rustics of a more doubtful characterto wit the armed and lawless carbonari and mountaineers the brigands with their sugarloaf hats velveteen jackets and sandalled feetlooked forth from the dense forests and coverts wherein they lurked defying alike the anathemas of the archbishop of reggio and the powers of the high court there and thought the time was near to inspect their guns and stilettoes and set their wives to abandon the distaff for the bulletmould as none knew on what errand those troops had come or what might ensue ere long and strange things were expected for mazzini and the liberator had been busy with their manifestoes even the fata morgana had been showing strange optical delusions of late in the bay of reggio and the straits of messina the battle of aspromonte had been fought in their vicinity during the preceding month garibaldi as all the world knows intent on raising an insurrection in hungary had placed himself at the head of a body of sicilian volunteers in the forest district of ficuzza twenty miles from palermo and by a hasty and illadvised movement he landed these men from two steamers on the calabrian shore where on the mountain plateau of aspromonteone of the highest of the calabrian hills rising immediately behind the town of oppidohe was attacked by the royal italian troops under colonel pallavacino he fell wounded by a musketshot in the ankle while all his people were surrounded and made prisoners military executions followed on many though the liberator for his great services in the cause of italian independence was never brought to trial and now the young grass was sprouting above the earthy mounds and round the rude little crosses that marked where the dead lay in their lonely graves on the slope of the apennines for two noted brigands who had accompanied him named agostino velda and giuseppe rivarola rewards were offered at that time in vain the excitement in oppido was in no way lessened when the sound of bugles came on the evening wind and ere long the 3rd regiment of bersaglieri or italian rifles in the service of victor emanuel with their plumed hats and quaint uniforms marched into the town and halted before the albergo del leon doro where the colours were lodged and the lieutenantcolonel commanding took up his quarters the soldiers were placed in an empty monastery a guard was mounted there and also at the albergo and then it began to be whispered about in the marketplace and cafés that the bersaglieri were to remain there until a captain arrived from reggio with some special instructions for the colonel vincenzo il conte manfredi of whom we shall hear more anon these rumours were unpleasantly connected with a bersagliere named agostino veldathe same velda who had followed general garibaldi and who had been brought in with the quarterguard as a prisoner and was now in a cell of the monastery heavily ironed and under the strictest surveillance among the bersaglieri of colonel manfredi were two soldiers of the name of veldathe prisoner agostino and his son raphael a youth of little more than twenty years who bore a character as high and unblemished as that of his father was degraded and low dissipated and vile yet the father and son were both eminently handsome men and both had fought bravelythe former on the fields of goïto and novara and the latter at montebello and solferino but latterly to many crimes and breaches of military law agostino had added that of desertion and consorting with brigands among whom he narrowly escaped an assassination in which he became involved and a notice of this event found its way even into the times he had thrown aside his uniform adopted the wellknown costume of the brigandsa gailyembroidered jacket a high hat with broad flaunting ribbon and long leathern gaitersand armed with a rifle and sixbarrelled revolver made his lurkingplace among the mountains near naples not far from acerraan episcopal city in the province of lavorofor a year prior to the affair of aspromonte he had taken up his residence with a formidable bandit and his wife with whom he lived concealed in a vault the fragment of some ruined castle or villa of the old days of roman naples there they might have resided long enough together and made perilous the road to rome but for the sum of two thousand ducats which had been put upon the head of agostino velda after garibaldis defeat and which proved too much for a friendship such as theirs one day after a close pursuit his padrona assured him that he might safely issue forth as the police had disappeared but immediately on velda raising the trapdoor which was covered with turf and branches to conceal their den he was struck to the earth by a blow from an axe dealt full on his head by a most unsparing hand assisted by his wife the padrona dragged the body to a ditch close by and then stabbing her to death he departed at once to naples where he claimed the reward offered for agostino velda whom he accused of killing the woman but velda was not deadsuch men are hard to kill he was simply stunned grievously wounded and made hideous by the blood that covered him he managed to crawl to the nearest house of the national guard to whom he told his story denouncing as his accomplice the padrona who was seized and shot as the reward of his crimes while he velda was sent back under escort to the 3rd bersaglieri then on their march to calabria to overawe the brigands in that mountain region and he was now under sentence and waiting the result of his trial the papers connected with which had been forwarded for approval to general enrico cialdini who in the subsequent year was appointed leader of the entire italian army and viceroy of naples with full power to repress brigandage the proceedings of the courtmartial by which the father had been tried were actually engrossed by the hand of his son who was the clerk to the regiment and he knew all the papers contained save the sentence which was known to the sworn members of the court alone but he could not doubt the tenor of it shame and gloom clouded the dark and handsome face of the young man and this dejection was held sacred by his comrades though it has been said that colonel manfredia man of weak and vicious character one moreover who was fierce reckless and dissipatedwas cruel enough on more than one occasion to taunt the innocent son with the errors of the guilty father the sun was verging towards the watery horizon of the gulf of gioja and the shadows of the apennines were falling far athwart the deep and wooded valleys that lie eastward of oppido when full of sad terrible and bitter thoughts the younger velda left the little city and after pausing once or twice to cross himself before the little lamplighted madonnas at the street corners hurried towards a spot which was familiar to him for he was by birth a calabrian and like his father before him had first seen light among those very mountains where aspromonte had been fought under the circumstances in which he was placed the young soldier gazed sadly on the scenes of his infancyon the forest paths and secluded places where he had been led by the hand of his mother who had perished of fever and fright after the battle of novara raphael velda walked rapidly onward for a few miles through a district that was rich in fruit trees where the lemon and citron the fig the vine and the orange were growing till he reached a region that was rocky and wild and where the majestic oaks and pines of that extensive tract known as the forest of la sila celebrated even by virgil in the twelfth book of the æneid cast a deepening shadow over the way he pursued and where the goat the buffalo and the wild black swine appeared at times amid the solitude brightly streamed the evening sun through the openings in the forest while raphael with unerring steps trod a path that had been familiar to him in boyhood and at last reached the place he sought it was a cavern in the gray basaltic rocks but the entrance known only to the initiated was carefully concealed by the hand of nature for the wild figtrees the vines and other luxuriant creepers completely screened it from the casual eye oh francesca my love my love what an abode for you muttered the soldier as he saw it but the place was silent as the grave the hum of insect life and the gurgle of a mountain rivulet whose course was hidden by the verdure alone met his ear francesca my betrothed the wife of my heart passing through the screen of leaves raphael velda came to a barrier of wood wedged between the walls of rock and on this he knocked with a resolute hand though his heart was throbbing with anxiety after a pause a sound most unpleasantly like the click of a gunlock met his quickened ear and he hastily knocked again chi è la who is there demanded a stern voice tis i good giuseppea friend the wooden barrier sharply revolved on its centre and within the cavern half seen in ruddy sunlight and half sunk in dark brown shadow appeared the picturesque figure of a man whose attire and bearing proclaimed him to be a calabrian brigand strong and athletic in form erect and dignified in carriage the lines of his dark face and his keen wild eyes declared him to possess an ardent and fiery spirit but his garments were tattered and miserable his beard was long and its natural raven blackness was becoming silvered by time his sash contained a brace of pistols and a hornhafted knife and in his hands was a long doublebarrelled rifle which was cocked and held menacingly for the naturally ferocious expression of his face deepened when he saw the hostile attire of his visitor a friend he exclaimed scornfully do the friends of giuseppe rivarola wear the uniform of the kings bersaglieri true i am a soldier giuseppea soldier of the king yet am i not the less your friend replied velda gently back i say i seek not your friendship boy and i want not your blood yet continued the robber wrathfully how am i to save my own if i permit you to return alive after having dared to track me to my hidingplace as rivarola spoke he involuntarily raised the musket to his right shoulder hold giuseppe rivarola cried his visitor have you quite forgotten me i am raphael the son of agostino velda the brigand uttered a cry threw down his musket and springing forward with all that volubility of gesture and violent declamation which proclaims the calabrian a genuine child of naturea rough and impetuous mountaineerhe embraced the young man took him in his arms and led him into his hidingplace it was indeed a squalid den and lighted only by a few dim rays of the fading sunshine which stole in through fissures in the basalt in a recess a little madonna of coarse clay was fixed to the wall of rock and the flame of a brass oillamp was flickering before it beneath lay a bed or rather a pallet the neat arrangements of which indicated the presence of a female hand outside this lay a couch of leaves and deerskins whereon doubtless old rivarola snatched his few hours of repose some vessels of coarse pottery an iron pot a bulletmould a powderflask and other similar et cetera made up the furniture and raphael looked round him with a saddened and anxious eye francesca said he inquiringly she has gone to vespers and to market at oppido the poor child requires other comforts than my gun can procure her on these bleak mountain sides or even on the highway for few men travel now without an escort of the carabinieri i am in hopes that she may be employed as a zitellaa girl who will make herself usefulby the good sisters of the benedictine conventgod and his mother bless them continued the brigand lifting off his old battered hat with reverence the sisters pity her for her own sake though they execrate me as one of the godless garibaldini once that our francesca is safe within their walls i shall go farther west among the mountains where some of the men of aspromonte are still lurking though heaven knows that to leave this place for that may be only noi cadiamo da scilli in cariddi he added using the old classic proverb but while talking of my own affairs i forget yours what of your father my boy he has been taken by the national guard and is now with us in oppido but under sentence of death as i too justly fear it must be replied raphael in a broken voice rebellion desertion treason and robbery what else could be the penalty of these but death he will be shot of course by the bersaglieri alas yet you will continue to wear their uniform said the old brigand his moustaches quivering with anger i follow the dictates of my conscience conscience replied the other grimly i had such a thing about me once but now well well are they safe for francesca or safe for you these evening errands into oppido she goes in as the twilight falls and always returns after dark when none can see the way she takes but our perils will be increased now that your precious bersaglieri are so close at hand they are increased giuseppe a list of persons to be captured and shot if found with arms in their hands or who prove unable to give a satisfactory account of themselves has been given by cialdini to the conte manfredi and your name is the first on that fatal roll of which i made a copy no later than yesterday by the contes order the outlaw only laughed at this and his white teeth glistened under his dark moustache they will never discover my retreat said he oh be not too sure of that it has served me ever since that fatal day at aspromonte you are wrong either francesca has been watched or some one has betrayed you none could betray me my secret is known to francesca and myself alone replied the outlaw confidently a clue to your hidingplace is in the hands of the conte manfredi and ere tomorrowyea tonight perhapsa cordon of riflemen will be around it povero amico i swear to you that this is the truth and my francesca exclaimed rivarola mournfully as he clasped his brown hands she is herehere at last cried the young man as a girl sprang into the cavern but on beholding his uniform she uttered a low cry of terror and shrank behind her father her figure was slender and petite yet she was fullbosomed and beautifully rounded her eyes were dark but bright and sparkling and softened in expression by their wonderfully long lashes which like her hair were black as jet her attire was poor but plain and neat even to being piquante and pretty her scarlet bodice was handsomely embroidered and her habitshirt like the square fold of linen that shaded her face was white as snow and contrasted well with the almost olive hue of her complexion o padre mio i have been pursued she exclaimed by whom asked rivarola starting to his musket an officer of the bersaglieri but i escaped him in the forest oh my father my father and a bersagliere is here before me raphael velda your betrothed said the young man taking off his plumed hat and coming forward from the shade which had partly concealed him uttering a soft exclamation of joy mingled with astonishment the girl rushed into his arms and he covered her face with kisses showering them on her brow her lips and eyes even on her neck where hung her only ornament a little crucifix of brass ne sono estatico i am in ecstasies the young soldier continued to murmur as he gazed upon the upturned face that lay upon his fringe epaulette and so near his own flushed cheek oh what happiness responded the girl i am beside myself with joy raphael raphael speak to me thou art loved by every one my child said the old brigand who made no attempt to check the free emotions of the lovers but turned away sadly and leaned upon his long musket oh francesca many maynay must have loved you but none as poor raphael velda does said the lover if ever we are parted judging by what i have suffered already the wrench will be terrible francesca will die murmured the girl no female society ever afforded me the delight that yours does and were we to be together for days and days instead of a few short stolen hours i would never weary of looking into your sweet eyes how often in camp and on the march when weary and listless i have longed for your beloved shoulder to lay my head upon and go to sleep though i fear your presence would put all sleep to flight oh raphael when absent from you i seem only to endure existence all time seems lost that is not spent with you and one of our officers pursued you francesca asked raphael after a pause yes my belovedfrom the gate of oppido along the highway and close up to the forest where i eluded him by lurking behind an ilex tree while he passed on is he old or young a man of some fifty years with long gray moustaches curled up to his ears dio tis the colonelthe conte manfredi the greatest roué in all naples never mindsoldiers are used to run after pretty girls you have escaped him and if he comes hither my gun will do the restthere will be promotion for the major said rivarola calmly but the handsome face of velda became troubled and clouded his love for francesca was deep and passionate yet as a soldier could he marry and make her a campfollowerthe jest perhaps of his comrades the prey perchance of such a man as the conteshe with all her purity and beauty a soldier could he with safety wed the daughter of a brigandan outlawone of the garibaldini she had been seen and pursued by his roué colonel also to complicate and make matters more dubious perilous and difficult be one of usthrow your allegiance to the winds and take to the mountains the brigand would have suggested but raphael was loyal and good and mourned the lost lives of rivarola and his doomed father but now the sun was set and he knew that he must soon return to quarters as he had only leave till midnight and taking his gun rivarola prepared to accompany him a little distance on the way the lovers separated with an arrangement for their meeting on the morrow and from the screen of leaves that hid her wretched home the poor girl with eyes halfblinded by tears watched their figures retiring through the forest but scarcely had they been gone ten minutes when both came rushing back to her the face of raphael was deadly pale that of rivarola inflamed by passion and in his eyes there sparkled a dangerous light conceal yourself my child a party of the bersaglieri are in the forest searching doubtless for me so i must fly but i shall leave your betrothed with you surely continued rivarola he will be able to protect you from his own comrades at least i will fire a shot to lure these men after me and away from this vicinity so if you hear it my children be not alarmed to heaven and your love i trust her raphael adieu he pressed the terrified girl almost convulsively to his breast sprang up the rocks with his musket slung behind him and disappeared while raphael led francesca into the cavern and closed the door the task of soothing her was a delightful one but then came the reflectionwhat was he to do to remain there with her was impossible as ere midnight he would have to report himself to the quarterguard and could he leave her alonealone in the wild forest no she should return with him to oppido and seek at the benedictine convent that shelter which would not be denied her this was soon resolved on and though about to leave the cavern perhaps for ever she reverentially trimmed anew the votive lamp before the little madonna while raphael stole for half a mile or so into the forest to assure himself that his comrades were gone this proved to be the case as they had heard the distant random shot of rivarola and following it had disappeared heaven be praised said raphael aloud the road is clear for her and me he was returning to the hidingplace when a shrill cryalmost a shriekfrom francesca made him spring forward with all the speed he could exert and he saw with dismay that the barrier of wood and screen of leaves were alike thrown down and that an armed man stood within them all that his heart had foreboded of evilthe climax of every vague apprehension to which the soul of raphael velda had been a preywas reached when he beheld his beautiful little francesca struggling to free herself from the grasp of her visitorhis colonel the conte manfredi of all men in italy the man from whom he had most cause to fearthe man who held in his hands perhaps the life of his father agostino velda and his own life as a consorter with outlawshad now tracked out francesca as a new prey this was but an example probably of how oft the power to do ill deeds makes ill deeds done raphael knew that the conte was a man without scruple or conscience possessed of vast wealth of high rank and a position which enabled him always to crush with success all who opposed his wishes however vile or cruel those wishes might be and raphael was but a poor bersagliere whose father was a convicted brigand all this foreknowledge rushed upon the mind of raphael and for a moment he was paralyzed with dismay but a moment only the next saw him tear francesca from the grasp of the conte whom he thrust without much ceremony aside in an instant the blade of the colonels sword glittered in his hand in guardia signore in guardia cried he in a voice that was tremulous with rage while raphael who had no other weapon than the short swordbayonet of the bersagliere promptly drew it to defend himself and therewith he parried one or two thrusts that were aimed at his breast as yet the colonel had not recognized him for the cavern was dark or only lit by the tiny votive lamp that flickered above the humble couch of francesca ha signore spadaccino said manfredi mockingly ill be through your body this time but by a rapid circular parry and great strength of wrist raphael twisted the sword from the hand of the conte who then drew a pistol all this passed in a few seconds while francesca crouching behind raphael looked upward with her face blanched by terror and now as he levelled the pistol the conte for the first time discovered that his antagonist was a soldier como vi chiamente what is your name he asked in a voice of thunder raphael velda signore ehi one of my own men too illustrissimosii have the honour replied raphael with a profound salute but keeping his sword drawn nevertheless oh raphael my love my love you are lost spare him signore colonello spare him cried francesca he is too young to die leave this place raphael velda said the conte in a low hoarse voice never indeed when are you due at oppido i have my captains leave till midnight signore mezzanotte good it wants but two hours of that time now said the mocking conte looking at his watch you know i presume the penalty of drawing upon a superior officer nonot when in defence of my own life and of one who is dearer to me than life veramenteindeed drawled the other curling up his enormous moustache which he wore in imitation of king victor emanuel this girlthe daughter of a brigandof a garibaldinois beyond the pale of all protection she is my betrothed wife signore said raphael with a deep burst of emotion your life is in my hands velda as a consorter with outlaws not more a consorter than yourself signore if the mere fact of being here makes me one insolent yet i will spare your life on one condition name it signore that you will never mention what has transpired here tonightour combat and my disarmament swear it by the god that hears you and the soul of the girl you love raphael felt astonished at a punishment so unlike manfredi but swore as he was requested good said the colonel picking up and sheathing his sword i give you life for silence but my vengeance will come on the morrow and with these ominous words which the unfortunate raphael connected in some way with his imprisoned father the colonel quitted the dreary abode of the rivarolas and disappeared in the forest the moment he was gone raphael raised francesca and strove by his caresses to reassure her he affected to make light of the threats of manfredi expatiated on the promises he had given as a reward for silence expressed joy that her father had escaped and as soon as she had regained her composure he led her from the cavern and together hand in hand with their minds mutually oppressed by fear for the future they pursued the highway almost in silence till they reached the little city of oppido adieu raphael said the girl weeping on his breast oh francesca my dearest francesca i cannot tell you how i love you and this love continues if possible to grow every day my whole soul is yours francesca and i shall yearn long and wearily for you till we meet again separate from you the most sunny days are gloomy to me and i seem to shiver as if chilled by the tramontana and now after a long and passionate kissa last one as it provedthey separated at the gate of the convent of santo benedetto and fortunately for raphael he was in quarters before the time necessary and amid their dull monotony the voice of francesca ever lingered in his ear some valets or emissaries of the conte were at the cavern betimes before daybreak the cage was empty and its pretty bird flown they knew not whither and this only served to inflame him the more against the elder velda next morning the shrill brass bugles of the bersaglieri were blown at an unusually early hour while the mountain summits were yet red with the first rays of the morning sun and the whole battalion paraded under the orders of the conte for the expected captain had arrived overnight from reggio with his final instructions and rumour said with the deathwarrant of agostino velda the latter seemed to be fully verified by the fact that the regimental chaplaina franciscan friarhad spent the greater portion of the night in his cell it was a lovely italian morning and never did the towering apennines look more beautiful in their verdure and fertility while the red rising sun cast their purple shadows and those of the great pines and oaks which clothed their sides far to the westward to the east dotted by many a white sail the blue mediterranean spread away towards the lipari isles and the smoke of many a steamer towered high into the deep azure of the dome above the straits of messina and the bay of gioja the plain where the bersaglieri who derive their name from bersaglio a mark or shootingbutt were paraded was a solitary spot about a mile distant from oppido in a rugged ravine overhung on all side by masses of rock which had been rent into fantastic shapes seventyseven years before by the dreadful earthquake of 1783 the troops were unpopular among the calabrese so none of the inhabitants were present to witness the morning parade which on the part of the conte manfredi embraced a scheme for vengeance such as an italian heart of a certain calibre alone could conceive the welltrained bersaglieri stood silent and firm in their ranks the only motion there being the fluttering of their darkgreen plumes which were caught by the passing breeze their swordbayonets were fixed on their rifles as the regiment formed three sides of a hollow square and the broad blades of these reflected gayly the sheen of the morning sun on the vacant side of the square stood an upright post firmly placed in the earth with a stout rope dangling from it at this object the eyes of the soldiers looked grimly but sternly from time to time the officers leaned on their swords and yawned wearily in the early morning air since the field of aspromonte they had grown tired of the perilous work of brigandhunting and looked forward with something of dismay to the rustication of dull quarters in the mountain city of oppido while knowing that at reggio there were the great cathedral with its aisles of paintings where people may flirt if they do not pray the theatre the opera and the promenade of the porto nuovo where girls handle their fans as girls only do in spain and italy even the yearly fair would be lost to the bersaglieri it was all a profound bore while such empty regrets occupied the minds of many the heart of raphael velda was a prey to a grief and horror all its own he and all the regiment thought that he should have been spared a scene so horrible as the execution of his own father he had proffered this request personally and through the captain of his company but in vain the conte was inexorable he only gave one of his sinister smiles and shrugged his shoulders in token of refusal so pale as a spectre and trembling in every fibre raphael stood under arms in his usual place agostino velda though an old soldier of the corps who had as we have said fought loyally on the field of goïto in lombardy and that of novara in piedmont was viewed now only as a disgrace a brigand and garibaldino so although all sympathized with his son and deprecated his presence on an occasion so awful they cared little otherwise about the impending execution but how little could they foresee the terrible triple tragedy which was to ensue on that bright and sunny morning parade from the lower end of the ravine was seen the gleam of approaching bayonets and the prisoner appeared with fetters on his hands walking slowly between a file of bersaglieri and by the side of the chaplaina very reverendlooking old man who wore the garb of a franciscanand who had been praying with him all night in the vault of the old castle which served as a dungeon and now poor raphael felt an icy shudder pass over his whole frame as his father drew near he had already that day at dawn taken a passionate and affectionate farewell of him and they were to meet no more on earth but yet the dark and haggard eyes of agostino velda wandered restlessly and yearningly along the ranks as if in search of a beloved face he was a splendidlooking man in the prime of life his stature was great and his bearing lofty and commanding the pallor of his face contrasted strangely with the raven blackness of his voluminous beard and hair the latter seemed to start up in sprouts from his forehead and temples and fell backward like the mane of a lion his eyes were darkdark as the doom that awaited him and their usual expression was fierce defiant and lowering he was bareheaded and muffled in an old regimental greatcoat which was intended to be his shroud i have repented of all my faults and crimes said he in a firm voice and with a collected manner i see now old comrades the folly the wickedness of my past life and am ready to die for it the proceedings of the courtmartial were then read over by the adjutant and they closed with the sentence that hethe said agostino velda lately a bersagliere of the 3rd regiment and now a brigandwas to be tied to a post and shot to death by any three soldiers whose doubtful character might lead the colonel to select them for that duty as a species of punishment the hand of manfredi seemed to tighten on his bridlerein as he heard this and there passed a grim smile over his face as he handed a pencilled memorandum to the sergeantmajor who changed colour as he read it and in his utter confusion actually forgot to salute his officer under whose glance most of the bersaglieri cowered for he was supposed to possess that terror of the italians an evileye he paused for a moment irresolutely and then turned to obey for discipline and obedience become a second nature to a soldier while the pioneers bound the passive prisoner to the stake the perplexed sergeantmajor summoned from the ranks two soldiers who had been punished repeatedly for breaches of discipline and twice for robbery as their names had been given to him by the colonel then pausing slowly before the company in the ranks of which raphael velda stood pale as a sheet and supporting himself on his rifle he summoned him to step forth as the third fire to complete the firingparty a thrill of horror and dismay seemed to pervade the whole regiment on witnessing this and now raphael rushed to the front signore illustrissimooh colonello mio he exclaimed in a piercing voice while gesticulating with all the fervour of a true calabrian dio buono you cannot mean this it is too crueltoo terrible the king will resent itgeneral cialdini will never permit it he added wildly and incoherently while his tongue seemed to cleave to the roof of his mouth in a paroxysm of grief he knelt before the conte entreating him to alter the terrible selectionto forego this subtle scheme for vengeance while the pale prisoner who saw and understood the whole situation uttered a cry of grief and dropping the crucifix which the chaplain had placed in his hands covered his face with them what can be the meaning of this was whispered round the ranks raphael alone could have told but he was sworn to secrecysecrecy by gods name and the soul of francesca in vain did the majora gallant old soldier who possessed great influence in the corpsurge the conte to change his plan in vain did the venerable chaplain supplicate on one hand and threaten on the other and in vain also did raphael velda whose voice had now left him stretch his hands towards the conte in mute entreaty vincenzo manfredi was inexorable i do not command the son to shoot the father but the loyal bersagliere to slay the convicted felon said he and then with a voice and bearing that forbade all hope of his revoking an order which filled the regiment with indignation and bewildermentfor the character of raphael was unimpeachable and even were it not so the selection was alike cruel and unnaturalhe ordered the firingparty to fall in at fifty yards distance from the criminal and to load and cap their rifles then the remainder of the obnoxious task was to be performed by the sergeantmajor sono allo desperazionei am in despairoh francescaoh my father moaned raphael as he loaded mechanically and knew that even if he fired in the air he would throughout all his future life be branded as a parricideas the executioner of his own father a blindnessa horror like a great darknessseemed to come over him and for a few moments he was beside himself with excess of emotion for a second or so the idea of shooting manfredi at the head of the regiment occurred to him but only to be dismissed for that officer was so placed that he could not have been hit without the risk of killing another and now like an automaton he found himself kneelingone of three executionersbefore his father at fifty yards distance though horror blanched his face agostino looked proudly and steadily at the three dark tubes from whence his doom was to come for at the word three the executioners were to fire uno cried the sergeantmajor in a voice that was quite unlike his own due tre reverberating with a hundred echoes among the rocks as the sounds were tossed from peak to peak four rifles rang sharply in the clear morning air and three men fell dead they were agostino velda pierced by two bullets in his head which sank heavily forward on his breast raphael who by an expert use of his bayonet as a lever after uttering a prayer to heaven and for francesca had shot himself through the heart and lastly the conte manfredi who pierced by a bullet fired from the rocks above threw up his hands with a wild scream and fell lifeless from his horse his fall and the suicide of raphael velda were so totally unexpected that the bersaglieri were utterly bewildered and confounded the double catastrophe was almost terrifying even to old soldiers but the major was the first to recover his presence of mind and at the head of a company proceeded to surround and scale those rocks from whence the mysterious bullet had come no trace of the assassin could be found save a long and doublebarrelled rifle which had been recently discharged and on the stock of which was carved the name of the noted brigand giuseppe rivarola so not a doubt remained that by his hand the conte had perished in vain were the mountains searched and princely rewards for his apprehension offered by general cialdini and the king for giuseppe was never seen afterwards though he is supposed to be still lurking among the wilds of the abruzzithe promised land of the italian brigands as a suicide the hapless raphael velda was buried in a solitary place and in unconsecrated ground but yearly on the anniversary of his deaththe festival of st michael and all angelsthere comes a benedictine nun who kneels by the green sod that covers him and with beads in hand and head bent low and reverently says a prayer for the repose of his soul she then hangs a wreath of fresh flowers on the little cross that marks his grave and glides slowly and sadly away la belle turque the story of the princess cécile of all the wandering claimants to royalty scions of kings retired from business soidisant regal pretenders false or realwhether like perkin warbeck or the six demetriuses of russia some more recent pseudoheirs of the house of stuart who figured in austria after the quarterly drove them out of scotland the duke of normandy in london and so forth who have appeared from time to time none have had so marvellous a story to tell as the princess cécile la belle turque as she was named who announcing herself in two volumes octavo to be a daughter of the deposed sultan achmet iii took the heedless world of paris by surprise about a hundred years ago and whose narrative has frequently been classed with romances though it came forth as a veritable history and with a title more clearly avowed than that of ascanius or the adventurer in scotland the editor who guaranteed its truth was a man of veracity and credit in his day and he urged upon the public that however extraordinary and romantic her adventures might appear they were nevertheless strictly fact and in a letter addressed to the editor of the journal de paris in 1787 he added that in that year the lady was still alive in the french capital and notwithstanding her advanced age in the enjoyment of good health it is singular that her narrative whether false or true as given by herself and m buisson littéraire hôtel de mesgrigny rue des poitevinsas it would furnish ample materials for the largest threevolume novelescaped the eyes of alexandre dumas or viscount darlincourt as it is full of adventures of the most stirring kind and told briefly runs thus the introductory part of her story in which the names of persons of rank are concealed contains necessarily the adventures of her governess or nurse by whom she was first abducted from her home and brought to france it would appear that about the year 1700 a mademoiselle emilia sic daughter of a surgeon in the french seaport town of génes was with her lover a young genoese named salmoni in a pleasureboat upon the mediterranean a little way from the coast when notwithstanding la terreur du nom de louis xiv they were pounced upon by some turkish corsairsa common enough event in those days and one not unfrequent even after lord exmouth demolished algiers this occurred in the dusk and the voice of salmoni who had been singing is supposed to have first attracted them being armed the italian defended his love and his life with courage but fell severely wounded and was left for dead in the bottom of his boat which floated away the sport of the waves while emilia was carried off and in consequence of her great beauty was ultimately sold at constantinople under the name of fatima for the service and amusement of achmet iii who in consequence of her accomplishments made her a species of governess to his children instead of retaining her among the odalisques in the seraglio this must have been subsequent to 1703 when achmet began his troublesome reign she was in this situation of trust when salmoni who had never forgotten her after a long and unsuccessful search through many seaport towns in the levanta veritable pilgrim of loveaccidentally discovered by a casual conversation with a turkish seaman where she was and how occupied for this man had been one of the corsairs crew disguised as a turk and giving out that he was the father of fatima the trusted slave salmoni found means to communicate with her through an itchcoglan one of the slaves or pages attached to the seraglio and they were thus enabled to see each other and converse their hasty meetings being but stolen moments of tenderness and joy emilia was now in attendance upon a little daughter of achmet iii born in 1710 and then six months old her mother was the sultana aski formerly a georgian slave and then one of the kadines or wives of the sultan ladies whose number rarely exceeds seven emilia was high in favour with both achmet and this sultana as she had been particularly serviceable to the latter at the birth of the child through some little skill she had acquired from her father the surgeon thus the confidence they reposed in her and the authority she possessed over all the people in and about the seraglio facilitated the execution of those plans for an escape suggested and urged by salmoni with a view to this end she desired the bastonghi or headgardener to make a seesaw which was in the gardens so high that sheand her pupils probablymight see the whole city from the lofty wall that girds this place where still the trees planted are always green that the inhabitants of galata and other places may not see the ladies at their lonely promenades aided by this seesaw she dropped over the wall a billet to salmoni desiring him to procure a ladder a steelyard to fix it to the masonry to make arrangements with a ship captain and when all was prepared to wait her beneath the wall of that terrible serai bournous which no slavewoman had ever yet left alive salmoni promptly obeyed her instructions he discovered a ship for the levant and by a note tossed over the wall informed her of the night and the very hour of their departure she was in the act of reading this noteprobably not for the first timewhen the sultan achmet suddenly entered her apartment and she had barely time to toss it unseen into a porphyry vase for this billet if discovered might have consigned her to the bowstring of the capidgibashi or the sack of the black channatoraga and its concealment forms an important feature in the story of the fugitives the houralmost the momentfor flight had arrived and salmoni she knew awaited her below the garden wall yet amid all the terror and anxiety of the time so strong was emilias love for the little babygirl of whom she had the chief care that she resolved to convey the child away with her and hoped eventually to rear it as a christian collecting all her jewels and those which achmet had already lavished on the infant she took with them the silken fetfa or record of its birth and to be brief escaped unseen by means of the steelyard and ladder as she descended the latter was held for her by a person in a gray cloak whom she believed to be salmoni and into whose arms she was consequently about to throw herself when another man started forward and plunged a sword into his breast he fled and a cry escaped emilia who fell to the ground but at that moment the captain of the vessel by which salmoni had arranged they should escape rushed up and tearing off the mufflings of the fallen man merely exclaimed it is not he and bore her off to the seashore an alarm had been given there was no time to wait for the absent salmoni she was placed at once on board the vessel which immediately sailed and made all speed to leave the golden horn behind she proved to be a small craft belonging to bayonne commanded by a young captain from dieppe who ultimately landed emilia and her charge at génes where her first care was to have the little turque baptized according to the rites of the catholic church this it is recorded was done by the curé of st eulalie de génes who named her marie cécile and in honour of an event so remarkable a salute was fired by the cannon of the château and those of the ramparts of the fort and three religeuses named respectively la mère st agnes la mère st modeste and la mère de lhumilité are mentioned as having taken a deep interest in the escaped fugitive and her charge who was kept in ignorance of her origin till her fifteenth year we know not how many daughters achmet iii is said to have had but in a letter of lady mary wortley montagu dated from adrianople she writes of his eldest being betrothed in marriage to behram bassa then the reigning court favourite and translates a copy of verses he had addressed to her cécile was now taken to several european courts at whichaccording to the narrativeshe was received with all the honours due to her illustrious rank in russia she was presented to the czar peter i who died in that year but in england she would seem to have contented herself with a short residence at a coffeehouse café in covent garden among other sovereigns she was presented to pope clement xi at rome where her beauty which she inherited from her georgian mother especially the profusion of her exquisite hair began to surround her with snares and perils in rome her guardian emilia had the joy of once more meeting salmoni the man who had been stabbed beneath the seraglio wall had not been he but the turkish corsair through whom he had first traced her there and who had hoped to make profit out of the intended escape by treacherously revealing it to the sultan and for this purpose he had plotted with a female slave attached to the palace this woman through whose hands the important billet passed had artfully erased the hour of twelve fixed by salmoni and substituted eleven hence though the sailor had full time to make the attempt he failed in the execution of his purpose so now after all their perils salmoni and emilia were married in the eternal city where the love affairs of la belle turque speedily began to attract notice first we are told that a duke fell in love with her but she made him her friend assuring him that he could never be more to her as she had already become inspired by a passion for a handsome young knight of malta who hoped soon to be absolved from his vow of celibacy while waiting for this the knights father old prince  as mischance would have it became enamoured of her reckless that he was a rival of his son and to avoid his importunities she and the salmonis set out suddenly for paris where by the knavery of a banker she lost much of the proceeds of the jewels brought from constantinople so that her fortune was reduced from sixty thousand livres yearly to about ten thousand in a coffeehouse at paris cécile chanced to see in the gazette de france an account of the misfortunes that had overtaken her father achmet iii this was in 1730 when that weak and imbecile voluptuary who had viewed with indifference the hungarian troubles and the wars of the north after being involved in a contest with russia by which he lost in succession the cities of asoph and belgrade and the provinces of temesvar servia and wallachia on the discomfiture of his arms by persia had an insurrection among his own subjects and was compelled by the janissaries to abdicate in favour of his nephew mustapha iii who threw him into a prison where he passed a life of mortification and shame after he had as voltaire has it sacrificed his vizier and his principal officers in vain to the resentment of the nation on reading of all these things cécile registered a vow that she would visit turkey seek out her father and endeavour to console him in his misfortunes and the death of her guardian emilia about this time together with the annoyance she experienced from the old prince who presuming on her friendless dubious and false position daily became more urgent and less respectful hastened her departure alone she set out for fontainebleau to solicit a passport as a french subject and to return thanks for the protection afforded her by the court of louis xiv but in returning to paris her carriage was stopped at night in the forest which then covered thirty thousand acres of hill and valley and there ensued an episode which by its coincidences seems too evidently romance though truth at times is stranger than fiction a handsomelyattired chevalierwho proved to be the princerequested her to alight and enter a voiture which stood there with six horses pleading that she would do so without compelling him to use violence on this she uttered a cry for help and ere long another voiture dashed up and there leaped out a gentleman sword in hand he proved to be the young duke de  her roman admirer and he had barely time to recognize cécile when her betrothed the knight of malta also appeared on the scene which thus becomes so melodramatic as to throw ridicule on the story the duke is about to deprive you of your mistress said the cunning old prince to his son let us jointly use our swords against him in defence of your dearest interests so thereupon the cavalier of malta ran the poor duke through the body in the most approved fashion bore off the fainting cécile to paris and placed her in the hotel of his father there the renewed but secret addresses of the latter so greatly alarmed her that on one occasion she had to protect herself by an exhibition of pistols after which she escaped with salmoni and the knight who urged that she should in fulfilment of her vow visit her captive father while he once more strove at the feet of pope clements successor to get the oath of celibacy absolved in turkey some unruly janissaries slew salmoni and were about to offer some violence to cécile despite her french passport when she displayed before them the fetfa this we are told was a piece of yellow silk on which was embroidered in golden letters the names of the sultan of her mother aski and herself with the day and hour of her birth together with certain passages from the koran the children of the sultans are bound with the fetfa immediately after birth and this document is deemed a sacred proof of their royal descent and at the sight of it every mohammedan must bow himself to the ground and defend with his life the wearer of it by this time her cousin mustapha iii was dead and his successor her kinsman mohammed v on hearing of her story and more than all of her beauty conceived a passion for her and sent his chief friend and confident the beglerbeg of natolia to inform her of the honour that awaited her being informed that it was the fame of her wonderful hair that had first excited the curiosity and admiration of the sultan she cut it entirely off and tossing it to the messenger go said she and give your master thisthe object of his loveand tell him that a woman capable of such a sacrifice knows no master but heaven and her own heart had chignons been then in fashion much trouble might have been saved the fair cécile who finding that a hasty departure from turkey alone could save her demanded but in vain a passport from the bashaw of smyrna or izmir urged by her father achmet she quitted secretly by sea and was landed by a french frigate at toulon where she learned from the lieutenant of a maltese galley that her lover had perished in a duel her journey to turkey had greatly impoverished her and now she found herself in france almost without a friend with only five hundred ducats and a diamond the gift of her father achmet iii choosing to conceal her fallen fortune from every eye she selected an humble dwelling in an obscure part of the city where long years after her editor first discovered her and where at a distance from royal thrones from human wealth and grandeur she had sought to pass the evening of her days in peace and obscurity god has blessed my fortitude she concludes born in 1710 i have lived to see the 1st of january 1786 and must now serenely and tranquilly await that peace by which death must make amends for all the surprising and afflicting changes of fortune which i experienced in my passage through life cécileif ever she existed at allmust have been then in her 76th year her narrative is certainly mentioned in the journal de paris but in the tide of events that so rapidly followed the year in which the financial troubles of france began the meeting of the statesgeneral and the crash of the first revolution following we hear no more of la belle turque the soidisant daughter of the dethroned achmet iii the marquis de fratteaux captain of french horse few events made a greater sensation in england generally and more particularly in london in march 1752 than the mysterious disappearance or abductionit was called for a time the murderof the unfortunate marquis de fratteaux who was actually dragged by force from the heart of the english metropolis and immured in the bastile to gratify the strange and unnatural hatred of his own father this noble whose name was louis mathieu bertin marquis de fratteaux chevalier of the order of st louis and a distinguished young captain of french cavalry was the eldest son of m jean bertin de st geyran honorary master of requests and counsellor to the parliament of bordeaux and of his wife lucretia de st chamant both of whose families were deemed by character and descent most honourable among the bordelais in the blazon ou art héraldique bertin is represented as bearing an escutcheon argent charged with a saltire simple dentelé  french encyclopaedie 1789 from his birth the marquis louis mathieu was an object of aversion to his father who on the other hand doted even to absurdity on his youngest son on whom he lavished all his love and his livres and on whom he bestowed the estate of bourdeille m bertin would seem almost from the birth of his second boy to have determined by every scheme he could devise to deprive the eldest of his birthright and this object he followed with singular rancour nearly to the end of his life it has never been hinted that m bertin suspected the paternity of his heir through life the conduct of madame bertin was irreproachable and above all suspicion in the infancy and boyhood of louis his father strove by systematic oppression and by cutting neglect to degrade mortify and break the spirit of the poor little fellow on all occasions giving the place of honour and the whole of his affection to his second son as his manhood approached his father proposed to him the profession of the law but as he weary of his unhappy home displayed an inclination for the army open war was at once declared by his father against him to more than one abbé did the young man in his misery appeal for intercession with his tyrannical parent but such appeals only made matters worse and the counsellor became so furious in his wrath that he made preparations to seclude louis in some strong vault or cellar of his mansion the marquis having discovered the residence of a young woman who was the mistress of his father paid her a secret visit told her the story of his unhappy life and domestic persecution and as his own mother seemed powerless in the matter on his knees sought her interest in his behalf she would seem to have been touched by the appeal and rated the counsellor soundly for his unnatural conduct threatening him with the loss of her affection if m louis were not left to his own inclination in the choice of a profession in the hope perhaps that some english or prussian bullet might rid him of a son whom he hated so cordially bertin permitted the marquis to join the regiment de noailles or 54th cavalry of the line commanded by the comte dayen nephew of marshal noailles as a cadet or volunteer but according to the system then pursued in the french service he could receive no pay or emolument even while campaigning in flanders and germany after fourteen months of this probation however he was gazetted to a cornetcy in the regiment de maine and at sixteen years of age became captain of a troop in the 40th cavalry or dragoons of st jal commanded by brigadier the comte de st jal his boyish spirit and bravery not to mention his rank having even then attracted the attention of comte dargenson who was prime minister of france from 1743 to 1757 the count prevailed upon louis the fifteenth to make the marquis a chevalier of the royal order and bestow upon him a special pension in lieu of the wretched pittance allowed him by his father  liste historique de toutes les troupe au service de france this early success in camp and at court seemed to inflame the resentment of the counsellor who now began to affirm that the marquis was not his son but a changeling or impostor substituted by the nurse for his first child who he declared had died while under her charge but as this story could be in no way sustained m bertin changed his tactics and resolved to get rid of his eldest son bypoison a fever with which fratteaux was seized about this time favoured the infamous idea and his father who visited him with an air of concern contrived to give him in his medicine a dose of some deadly drug which he called an infusion of bark it nearly proved fatal and would inevitably have done so but for the prompt arrival of the apothecary who had furnished it and who suspecting foul play when summoned by the marquis brought with him a powerful antidote the counsellor who was immensely rich now suborned some worthless fellows among whom was an italian name unknown to swear that fratteaux meditated a parricidal design against his life that the marquis having a quarrel with his father drew his sword and would have killed him but for the interposition of the father of the italian who received the thrust and died of it this deposition enabled bertin to purchase a lettre de cachet by virtue of which he had his son arrested and thrust into a monastery near bordeaux where he was treated as a prisoner though for the crime of attempted parricide he might have been broken alive on the wheel by the then existing laws of france through the great influence of bertin as a counsellor of parliament all his sons entreaties for release or for a public trial were rendered vain and he lost his commission in the regiment of st jal some of his friends however having discovered where he was confined and fearing that he might be secretly put to death broke into the monastery one night and assisted him to escape through gascony and bearn he fled to spain where without so much as a change of clothes without money or letters of introduction he arrived in a famished and destitute condition at the house of the comte de marcillac a relation of his mother who derived his title from the little town of that name nine miles north of bordeaux the counsellor soon discovered the place of his sons retreat and assisted by a liberal donation of gold soon procured from the french ambassador at madrid a warrant for the arrest of the fugitive based upon the powers afforded by that infamous instrument of tyranny the lettre de cachet once more the unhappy son had to fly the comte de marcillac supplied him with money and embarking at the nearest port he sailed for london where he arrived in 1749 there under the name of monsieur de st etienne he took a humble lodging in paddington then a country village with green fields all round it from marybone farm to kensington his landlord was a market gardener his friends in france and spain sent him remittances and letters of introduction to several persons of rank in london to these the pleasant manners gentle bearing and handsome person of the young marquis speedily recommended him and ere long he was enabled to remove nearer town where he boarded with a mrs giles in maryboneor as another account has it with one mrs bacon a widow gentlewoman of much good nature and understanding but even in this land of liberty he was not safe from the rancour of the indefatigable counsellor with his lettre de cachet the english friends of the marquis having urged that he should lay the story of his wrongs before louis the fifteenth in the form of a memorial the preparation of it was confided to an amanuensis a frenchman named dages de souchard this fellow though only the son of an obscure lawyer at libourne then a very small town of provence assumed in london the title of baron a deepwitted crafty and insinuating rascal he contrived to propitiate many unsuspecting persons and claimed to be a strict french protestant though he had in early life been a franciscan monk or friar minor in a monastery at nerac in the west of france and came of a family of rigid catholics nay while in the monastery he seduced a young girl named du taux whose mother was the lavandière of the establishment and they had come together to london where they gave themselves out as persecuted french protestants having been born within twenty miles of bordeaux this souchard knew the story of the marquis de fratteaux and conceived the idea of turning it to his own profit before it should reach the ears of louis the fifteenth for this purpose delaying the preparation of the memorial he wrote secretly to the counsellor stating that he knew where his son was and offering to make terms to secure and deliver him up the counsellor entered cordially into the scheme and after remitting him some money on account agreed to settle upon him for life a pension of six hundred livres and to pay him two thousand english guineas down with two hundred more for the reward of any assistants or accomplices he might deem necessary dages de souchard immediately set about his treachery and employed a man of most unscrupulous character one alexander blasdale a marshals court officer who resided in st martins lane and whose follower or colleague by a strange coincidence was the very italian who had been accessory to the incarceration of the marquis in the monastery near bordeaux on the night of the 25th of march 1752 they repaired to the lodgings of the marquis who immediately became deadly pale on seeing the italian and exclaimed in alarm and distress i am a dead man blasdale summoned him to surrender in the kings name knowing that he owed no man anything fratteaux was disposed to resist his landlady sent for m robart french clergyman to whom blasdale with cool effrontery showed a writ to arrest the marquis for a pretended debt the latter was persuaded to yield and to accompany the officer to his house in st martins lane whither he was immediately driven in a hackneycoach and there placed in a secure chamber five gentlemen one of them a person of the first fashion on hearing of the arrest repaired to the bailiff and in strong language warned him to beware of using the least violence towards his prisoner lest he should be called to a severe account and they added that sufficient bail would be found for him in the morning one gentleman named m dubois remained with the marquis as his friend resolved to see the end of the affair and to protect him but about midnight the italian came in saying that some one wished to speak with this gentleman below on descending to the street dubois found only the bailiff blasdale who roughly told him to be gone and thrusting him out of the house shut him out and secured the door on this gentleman returning with the french clergyman and others next morning they were told by a servantgirl that the marquis was gone in company with several gentlemen they then demanded to see her master but were curtly told that he was out of town in short neither he nor his victim was ever beheld in england again fears of foul play being immediately excited the whole party repaired to justice fielding by whom a warrant to apprehend blasdale was issued on suspicion of murder application was made to the lord chief justice and also to the secretary of state robert earl of holderness for a habeas corpus to prevent the marquis from being taken out of the kingdom dead or alive but all was of no avail and the fate of fratteaux remained for some time a dark mystery it would appear that on finding himself alone after the rough expulsion of his friend dubois the marquis became furious with rage on which blasdale swore that as he made so much noise in the house he would convey him at once to jail fratteaux who feared he might be assassinated where he was readily consented to go to jail and a hackneycoach was called in it he the bailiff and the nameless italian drove through various obscure streets and bylanes it was now about five in the morning the marquis again and again implored aid from the coach window in broken english but received none to the watch his keepers said that he was only a french fellow they had arrested for debt to others they said he had been made furious by the bite of a mad dog and they were going to dip him in salt water at gravesend thus his entreaties were abortive and at about sunrise he found himself at a lonely place by the side of the river thames a cocked pistol was put to his ear and resistance was vain he was thrust on board a small vessel which had been waiting for him in the river and which after he was secured below dropped down with the ebb tide so well did souchard blasdale and the italian take all their measures that on the night of the 29th the two lastnamed worthies landed the marquis at calais the gates of which town were opened to admit them long after the usual hour of closing he was then delivered over as a prisoner of state to the town authorities who had all been duly communicated with and probably well feed and by whom he was sent chained by the neck in a postchaise to his fathers house in paris the counsellor in virtue of his lettre de cachet now sent his son the marquis to be immured in the bastile for life this is the first narrative of the kind which has stained the annals of england says a print of the time and if it be not the last highly as we boast of giving laws to all europe we shall be little better in fact than a pitiful colony exposed to the mercy of every insolent neighbour great indignation was excited in london where a subscription was raised for the purpose of punishing all concerned in this flagrant violation of british law but nothing was achieved in the end though in january 1754one year and eight months after the outrage at st martins laneour ambassador at the court of versailles general the earl of albemarle demanded that both the marquis and his infamous trepanner alexander blasdale at that time in paris should be delivered up and sent back to london his request was never complied with and for fourteen years the luckless marquis was allowed to languish in the bastile  we are told that a foreign nobleman is already in custody of a messenger for this offence and no person is permitted to have access to him neither is he allowed the use of pen ink or papergentlemans magazine 1752 very probably this foreign nobleman was the baron dages de souchard he and his story were soon forgotten and nothing more was heard of him until some of the london papers of july 14 1764 contained the following paragraph the marquis de fratteaux that french gentleman who was some years ago forcibly carried off from england to france and confined in the bastile is now at liberty on his estate at fratteaux for when his brother m bertin de bourdeille was made intendant of lyons he obtained his liberty on giving his word of honour to remain on his estate at fratteaux and never to go above six miles from it without leave from his father with whom he had been at great variance which was the occasion of his leaving france two months after his arrival at fratteaux his father went to see him and he had permission to return the visit at bourdeille he has kept his word of honour strictly and lives at present in cordiality with the whole family broken in health and spirit by all he had undergone this unfortunate victim of a family feud and an unnatural hatred died soon afterwards and thus the wishes of his father were accomplished socivisca the story of a greek outlaw in the year 1688 that district of western turkey named montenegrothe ancient illyriaplaced itself under the protection of the venetian republic which was then governed by the doge francisco morosini a famous soldier who took the castle of the dardanelles from the turks together with lepanto and several other places for a time after this its inhabitants those halfgreek and halfslavonian mountaineers with the people of bosnia enjoyed comparative peace but by the treaty concluded at passarowitz in july 1718 between charles vi last count of hapsburg and the porte they were surrendered to the tender mercies of the turks and became subject to all the exactions of those grasping ignorant and impracticable conquerors however the hardy warriors of the mountains were scarcely content like their countrymen in the eastern portions of greece to live on despised and unmolested for the payment of tribute the worst and most humiliating feature of which was the number of children they were compelled to present yearly to the sultan for service in the seraglio or in the ranks of the janissaries where their identity soon became lost and where in the end they realized what voltaire termed a great proof of the force of education and of the strange constitution of human affairs that the most of those proud oppressors of christianity should thus be born of christian parents socivisca the subject of the following sketch was born at simiova in 1725 of grecian parents who reared and educated him in the profession and faith of the greek church he was strong hardy and athletic in form and of a haughty and resentful spirit that would ill brook the circumstances in which he found himself as he grew to manhood his father occupied a small sheep farm on the slope of those mountains whose forests of dark pine give a name to the people and the province but the proprietors were turks who treated the family which consisted of the old man and his four sons with great severity subjecting them to constant exactions insults and oppressions they were thus reduced to such extreme poverty that socivisca with all his industry aided by that of his three brothers nicholas giurgius and adrian found himself quite unable to marry a beautiful greek girl of whom he became enamoured in youth his father being of a peaceful and gentle nature and being perhaps aware of the hopelessness of resistance on perceiving that his sons writhed under their afflictions besought them to submit with patience to the will of god but the four young men being alike of a fiery and haughty spirit and moreover being trained to the use of those arms which the montenegrin shepherds constantly wear like the scots highlanders in the last century they received his advice in reluctant silence and not the less resolved to have a trial of strength some day with their mahommedan oppressors native hardihood and warlike spirit were in this instance added to national animosity and religious rancour thus socivisca like rob roy vowed that ere long those should tremble on hearing of his vengeance that would not listen to the story of his wrongs the montenegrins like most other mountaineers are eminently patriotic and the solemn and melancholy aspect of those dark hills of illyria that look down on the adriatic to their eyes must seem well to harmonize with the fallen state of greece and yet how lovely in thine age of woe land of lost gods and godlike men art thou thy vales of evergreen thy hills of snow proclaim thee natures varied favourite now though not pure greeks but zernagorzii of halfslavonian blood the montenegrins have the most extravagant ideas of independence and the past glories of their country inspired by its scenery by the real and imaginary stories of its departed greatness and present degradation socivisca and his brothers registered at the altar a vow of vengeance on their oppressive overlords and as if fatality had a hand in the matter it chanced soon after that the haughty turk the proprietor of their sheep farm accompanied by two of his brothers came either by choice or necessity to lodge at the farm this was in 1744 when socivisca was in his nineteenth year we are four to three said he so look to your pistols and yataghans after these dogs have had their food and coffee notwithstanding their vow it is said that he wavered for a time before performing the terrible deed but when he saw his fathers face sharpened more by want and privation than by agewhen he looked on the rags and sheepskins that clad them allthey the true lords of the soiland saw in contrast the rich flowing garments of fine silk and velvet laced with gold and the jewelled weapons of the three mahommedans in whose presence every wooden crucifix or gaudy little picture of a greek saint had to be hiddenand perhaps when the youth thought of his bride and all that might be if the land they trod on was indeed their own every scruple gave way and inciting his brothers to the deadly work they fell on the three turks as they lounged over their long pipes and slew them by their pistols and yataghans after a very brief resistance in their mails were found eighteen thousand sequinsan unexpected but most seasonable accession of fortune the brothers quickly buried the bodies and all their habiliments save the gold which was carefully concealed there remained no trace of the terrible deed and as it occurred unknown to all save themselves in that solitary little farm amid the savage mountain solitude no suspicion of the circumstance fell on them thus instead of taking to flight the greeks remained quietly where they were the pacha of bosnia made every inquiry after the three missing turks who were his friends suspicions somehow fell on other parties who were dragged to traunick and executed with great barbarity while socivisca wedded the girl he loved and lived with his father and brothers in comparative ease and comfort about a year after the triple assassination some imprudence of socivisca in displaying the latent pride and ferocity of his character together with the unusual amount of money the family were enabled to spend excited the surprise and then the ready suspicions of the pastoral people around them some whisper of these suspicions reached socivisca so by his advice the whole family abandoned the farm in the night and taking with them only their gold and their arms departed from the mountains towards the venetian territory the weather was severe the roads were rough and the elder socivisca unable to sustain privations so unwonted at his time of life expired of toil by the wayside and was hastily buried by his four sons in a wild and solitary place entering the territories of the republic where they were in safety in the year 1745 they took up their habitation in the town of imoski which is now in what is termed austrian dalmatia and on the borders of bosnia but in those days the old fortress on the hillthe site of the ancient novaniumbore the flag of venice here they gave themselves out to be traders and opened a bazaar which they stored with rich merchandise they built a large house and soon became almost wealthy but the easy life of a merchant by no means suited the temperament of socivisca and his brethrenfor the warrior shepherds pined for their mountain home and the forests of the illyrian shore they sold their house the bazaar and its goods and attended by stout fellows whose spirit was something like their own they returned again to montenegro and commenced a series of those forays and surprises against the pacha in which the black mountaineers delight and in the conduct of which they peculiarly excel and during the ensuing summer they contrived to massacre in various ways about forty turks as it was against them and them only that all the hatred of socivisca was directed the habits to which he had been accustomed from infancy preeminently fitted him for the life of a wandering guerrilla a montenegrin says broniewski a russian traveller is always armed and carries about during his most peaceful occupation a rifle pistols a yataghan and cartouchbox they spend their leisure from boyhood in firing at a target inured to hardships and privations they perform without fatigue long and forced marches climb the steepest rocks with facility and bear with patience hunger thirst and every kind of privation they cut off the heads of those enemies whom they take with arms in their hands and spare only those who surrender before battle seeking no mercy they yielded none and if one of their number was wounded severely his comrades cut off his head and when not tending their flocks like the circassians they spent their whole time in forays against the invaders of the black mountains but after a time socivisca grew weary of slaughtering and beheading the turks and returned once more to his wife and children at imoski where he remained till 1754 engaged in trade though now and then he slung his long rifle on his shoulder stuck his dagger and pistols in his girdle and crossed the bosnian frontier to indulge in his favourite pastime of slaying the turks in all his dealings and adventures whether as a merchant or guerrilla robber it could never be discovered that he wronged in the least degree any subjects either of the austrian empire or of the venetian republic meantime two of his brothers married and adrian the youngest joined the aiducos a band of morlachians who had leagued themselves together for the express but hazardous purpose of preventing the turks from crossing what they considered the frontier of their own country in short to defend the wooded passes of the black mountains brave rash cunning treacherous and cruel these morlachians are a mixture of hungarian greek and venetian blood and their religion is a mere mass of superstition partly christian and partly oriental the youth became the comrade of a morlachian of the greek church and chose him for his probatim this choice of friendship was always consecrated by a solemn ceremony at the altar of the nearest church before which they knelt each holding a lighted taper whilst the priest sprinkled them with holy water and blessed the compact united thus the probatims are bound for life to assist each other in war or peace in danger or adversity against all men whatsoever the young mountaineer however made an unfortunate choice of a friend for the probatim lured him to his own house gave him drugged wine and for a sum of money delivered him over bound hand and foot to the pacha of traunick which is one of the six military pachalics into which bosnia is divided after exposing the poor youth who was a model of manly beauty stripped and nude before the people the pacha put him to death amid the most exquisite tortures that the oriental mind can suggest on hearing of this atrocity socivisca was filled with rage and grief but dissembling he armed himself fully and travelled without stopping until he reached the residence of the false probatim whose father a subtle old morlachian received him with an air of such grief and commiseration that he succeeded completely in making our mountaineer believe that the son was innocent of the crime laid to his charge by common rumour the probatim next appeared and acted his part so well and shed so many tears that socivisca confounded and convinced gave him his hand and consented to dine with the family then the young morlachian said that in honour of such a guest he would kill the best lamb in his flock and he went forth but instead of going to his pastures he rode on the spur twelve miles to have a conference with the miralai who commanded a body of turkish horse on the bank of the danube and to inform him of where socivisca was to be found receiving from the officer a handsome sum for his second act of treachery the day wore on and evening came without either the lamb or the probatim appearing the wily host who knew what was on the tapis left nothing unsaid to satisfy the doubts of socivisca who after nightfall retired to his bedchamber but not to repose for strange and unbidden forebodings of coming evil tormented him he dared not sleep and he seemed to hear the voices of his wife and children mingling with the wind that shook the woods and with the tread of coming enemies his dogs alsotwo of that molossian breed which is unsurpassed for strength and ferocitywarned him by their snorts and restlessness of approaching dangerfor dogs at times are said to have strange instincts at last unable to endure the suspicions of peril and treachery he sprang from bed dressed himself in the dark and sought for his arms but they had been removed musket pistols yataghan and all were gone he called on his host repeatedly but without receiving an answer then inspired by rage and the conviction that like his brother he had been snared to his doom with a flint and tinderbox he lighted a lamp went forth to search the house and soon appeared by the bedside of his host wretch he exclaimed as he seized him by the beard my armswhere are they speak ere it be too late for us both every moment expecting to hear his son return with a party of turks the morlachian attempted to expostulate and to temporize but sociviscas eye fell on a small hatchet that lay near and snatching it up with a terrible malediction he cleft the old traitors skull to the chin on this a female servant dreading her masters fate gave socivisca his arms and he fled into the woods close by where he lurked long enough to see the probatim arrive with a party of timariots who surrounded the house on this the fugitive withdrew and retired towards the mountains swearing by every saint in his church to have a terrible revenge assembling his followers he descended in the night and guarding all the avenues to prevent escape he set fire to the house of the probatim who perished miserably with sixteen of his family all of whom were burned alive save a woman who was killed by a rifleshot when in the act of leaping from a window with an infant in her arms after these affairs the pacha of bosnia a threetailed dignitary who resided at traunick scoured the country with his timariots and made such incredible efforts to capture socivisca that though the latter multiplied his slaughters raids and robberies he was ultimately driven with his brothers his wife and two children a son and daughter over the montenegrin frontier to karlovitz a small place in the austrian territory famous only as the scene of prince eugenes victory over the ottoman troops in the early part of the last century the hungarians being like the illyrians of slavonian blood there he found a comfortable shelter for three years under the protection of the emperor francis i and the empressqueen and during that time his conduct and life were alike blameless and without reproach one of his brothers however having strayed across the frontier fell into the hands of the turks and would have died a miserable death had his escape not been favoured by one who proved friendly to him a timariot named nouri othman in october 1757 osman iii died and was succeeded by mustapha son of the deposed sultan achmet karlovitz is only forty miles from the bosnian frontier so the pacha who never lost sight of socivisca anxious to please the new sovereign and display his activity by a lavish disposal of gold and by the aid of some person or persons unknown had the exile betrayed and made prisoner he ordered him to be conveyed at once to traunick and to be placed in the same prison where his younger brother perished so miserably though elaborately tied and bound by some of that skill which the ropetricksters display in the present day he contrived en route to get free and escaping reached karlovitz where he had the unhappiness to find that by a singular stroke of misfortune his wife and two children had in the interim fallen into the hands of the pacha that in his flight he had actually passed them on the road and that they were now in the strong prison of traunick from which escape or release seemed alike hopeless by messengers from karlovitz he strove to negotiate for their release but the pacha was inexorable he then wrote the following letter which appeared in a newspaper for march 1800 where it was given as a curious specimen of social feeling operating on a rugged and ardent disposition moreover it is no bad specimen of the outlaws literary power i am informed o pacha of bosnia that you complain of my escape but i put it to yourself what would you have done in my place would you have suffered yourself to be bound with cords like a miserable beast and led away without resistance by men who as soon as they arrived at a certain place would put you to death nature impels us to avoid destruction and i have acted only in obedience to her laws tell me pacha what crime have my wife and little children committed that in spite of law and justice you should retain them like slaves perhaps you hope to render me more submissive but you cannot surely expect that i shall return to you and hold forth my arms to be loaded with fresh bonds hear me then pacha you may exhaust on them all your fury without producing the least advantage on my part i declare i shall wreak my vengeance on all turks who may fall into my hands and i will omit no means of injuring you for the love of god restore to me i beseech you my blood obtain my pardon from my sovereign and no longer retain in your memory my past offences and i promise that i will then leave your subjects in tranquillity and even serve them as a friend when necessary if you refuse this favour expect from me all that despair can prompt i shall assemble my friends carry destruction wherever you reside pillage your property plunder your merchants and from this moment if you pay no attention to my entreaties i swear that i will massacre every turk that falls into my hands as socivisca had been doing this for so many years past perhaps the pacha thought compliance would not make much difference so this letter like its preceding messages he received with contempt swearing by the beard of the sultan to listen neither to the threats nor entreaties of a common robber so socivisca performed to the full all that he had named and threatened at the head of a body of greeks and montenegrins he ravaged all the bosnian frontier slaying and decapitating every mussulman who fell into his hands seeking no quarter and giving none as before flames and rapine marked his path wherever he went many of his forays were made near the lake of scutari in concert with the montenegrins whom the russians supplied with arms and artillery to add to the troubles of the pacha of bosnia whose people ere long on their knees besought him to yield up the wife and children of socivisca and save them from a scourge so terrible still the pacha refused but suddenly the indomitable socivisca appeared with his hardy aiducos before the walls of traunick and by a wonderful combination of force and stratagem the gates were stormed the guards dispersed and he carried off his wife his son and daughter to a place of safety beyond the frontier in retiring from traunick at a wild place near razula his people captured one of the turkish timariots in the service of the pacha and would instantly have put him to death had not the brother of socivisca recognized in him the man who had favoured his escape a short time beforenouri othman these timariots were soldiers who clothed armed and accoutred themselves out of their pay and were under the immediate command of the sanjiac or bey and each maintained under him a certain number of militiamen as they were in fact highclass turkish cavaliers those on the hungarian frontier had each an income of 6000 aspres a coin then worth one shilling and threepence british money in gratitude the mountain warrior permitted othman to escape and while socivisca was at prayersa duty which he never omitted before a mealthe prisoner was set at liberty a fleet horse was given him and from the camp of the outlaws he spurred towards traunick against this act of generosity the aiducos of the band exclaimed loudly and a nephew of socivisca went so far as to draw from his girdle a long brassbutted pistol with which he struck his uncle on the face the latter infuriated by such an insult from a junior shot him through the heart and was compelled to fly from the troop the nephew was buried as his grandfather had been in a grave by the wayside but this family quarrel and double misfortune affected socivisca so much that he returned to karlovitz relinquishing alike his life of war and outrage for a time but for a time only for fired with enthusiasm on hearing that stephano piciola known as di montenero so often victorious over the turks had made himself master of all albania in 1770 he issued forth again at the head of his aiducos and scoured the bosnian frontier shooting down every turk whom he met in his fiftieth year after having led a life of such danger and strifeafter shedding so much blood and during a period of thirty years since the slaughter of the three turkish brothers at his fathers farm having plundered so much so freely had he spent his cash among his friends and followers that he found his exchequer reduced to only six hundred sequins to secure these he entrusted three hundred to the care of a kinsman and the rest to a friend both of whom absconded with their trust to the shelter of the pacha and left him in abject poverty in the small town of grachaez in the province of carlstadt on the military frontier of croatia in the year 1775 the emperor francis i when passing through the province wished to see the famous predatory warrior of whom he had heard so much and visited his humble abode at grachaez there he was so greatly struck with the simple dignity the resolute but respectful demeanour of the whitebearded partisan that he presented him with a handsome sum of money and asked him to show his numerous wounds and to detail the chief events of his life socivisca did so with so much simplicity and modesty that the emperor whom he pleased and amused and who was looking forward to the capture of the bukovine and other districts from the turks made him an offer of service and assigned him an important military command upon the hungarian frontier opposed to the great pachalics of bosnia and servia in the exercise of this office he was alive at grachaez in 1777 after which year his name can no more be traced in the histories papers or periodicals of the time so that we are unable to say when he died  arambassa of pandonas it is styled in the english newspapersa title we frankly confess ourselves unable to understand such was the wild romantic and singular story of a mountain robber whose life ultimately became productive of public utility who enjoyed the favour and protection of francis i and maria theresa and whose career in his unrelenting animosity to the turks presents a curious mixture of patriotism and ferocity religious enthusiasm and the longengendered rancour of rival and antagonistic races paquette an episode of the francoprussian war chapter i in the spring of the year 1870 when my merry paquette and i used to laugh at the cartoons of the kladderadatch representing king william lowering a mannikin in regimentals gently by the spike of his helmet into a huge chair inscribed spanien we little foresaw the horrors that were to come or the days when we might tremble at the warlike news of the official staatsanzieger we had been married a year and were so happy in our pretty little house at blankenese a short distance from hamburg where all the sloping bank above the elbe is covered with rich green copsewood from amid which peep out the tiny redtiled cottages of the fishermen while over all tower the whitewalled villas of those opulent merchants whose names stood so high in the neuerwall or the admiralitatstrasse and higher still in the bourse of the free cityfree now only in name as it has become since the holstein war an integral portion of the prussian empire paquette champfleurie was my first real love yet though still little more than a girl she was a widow when we married and it all came to pass in this fashion for we had indeed much sorrow before our days of joy arrived when i carl steinmetzfor such is my name though no relation to the great prussian generalwas but a lad in a merchants office in the quaint old gableended and timberbuilt street called the stubbenhuk i had learned to love paquette then a boarder in a fashionable school on the beautiful alsterdam our interviews were stolen our intercourse most difficult for her kinswoman the gräfine von spitzbergera reduced lady of rank with whom she was placed for educational purposeswatched her with the eyes of a lynx but what will not love achieve paquette a lively darkeyed and chestnuthaired girl from lorraine with a piquant little face that was not by any means french in contour or expression and i a sharpwitted burschen fresh from berlin soon found means for prosecuting our affair of the heart from the time when our eyes first met on a sunday evening in st michaels kirche to that eventful hour when after many a note exchanged or concealed in a certain hollow tree near the lombardsbrücke we plighted our troth in the little grove near schillers bronze statue with no witnesses but the quiet stars overhead and the snowwhite swans that floated on the blue current of the alster but sorrow soon came to rouse us from our dreams for three weeks after that happy evening her father took her home without permitting us to say farewell and ere long i learned that she had become the wife of baptiste graindorge a wealthy merchant of lorraine with these tidings the half of my life seemed to leave me they cost me many a secret tear and much jealous bitterness though i knew that french girls have no freedom of choice in matrimony and i loathed the odious graindorge in my heart while bending resolutely over my desk in the dingy and gloomy little office in the noisy stubbenhukbending also every energy to amass money though for what purpose now i scarcely know but fortune favoured me i became ere long a junior partner in the firm under whom i had worked as a clerk and the same year saw paquette free for our horrible graindorge had died abroad of fever at the french colony of senegal and she became minemine after all a widow no scheming father could interfere with her then in the whole of busy hamburg there could be no happier couple than we wereand this was but a year ago wedded we visited every place where we had been wont to meet by stealth in terror of the old gräfinethe leafy arcades of the young maidens walk the botanical gardens the groves that cover all the old mounds about the holstein wall and the banks of the alster while michaels kirche was indeed a holy place to us for there we had first met one morning in july of last yearah i shall never forget itwe were at breakfast together in the diningroom of our cottage at blankenese and prior to taking the sporvei bus for the city i was skimming over the staatsanzieger which was then beginning to be full of threatening news concerning the spanish succession and calling on prussia to rouse herself as all france or paris at least was shouting a berlin and to the rhine the atmosphere was deliciously warm the slender iron casements were wide open the fragrant roses and jessamine clambered thickly round them and the drowsy hum of the bees mingled with the sounds that came softened by distance from the vast shining bosom of the elbe where ships with the flags of all the world were gliding some towards jonashafen and the city others downward to the north sea and opposite lay the flat but green and lovely coast of hanover studded with pretty red villages churchspires and windmills whirling in the sunny air my heart felt happy and joyous and paquette was looking her loveliest in a light muslin morning dress her bright brown hair her pure complexion and her dark laughing eyes making her seem a very hebe as she poured out my coffee buttered the little brown german rolls and chirruped about how we should spend the evening after she had joined me in the city and we had dined as we frequently did under the shady verandah of the pleasant alster pavilion surrounded by swans and pleasure boats where shall we go carl darling she continuedto the circus renz no paquette i am sick of the horsemanship and the sawdust and the same everlasting girl who when she is not flying through a hoop prances about in the dress of a uhlan the botanical gardens then the band of the 76th hanoverians play there tonight and some ten thousand gay people will be present well darling it shall be as you wish and after looking in at the stadt theatre to see kathie lanners swedish ballet a droski will soon whirl us home from the damthorwall but it was in that theatre carl love we saw each other last and at a distance on the night beforebefore i began i was torn from you to become the wife of another carl she exclaimed in a low voice as she took my face between her pretty hands and kissed me playfully ah graindorge thought i with a little bitterness as i kissed her in return and rose to fill my meerschaum prior to setting forth for the city but a strange cry from paquette made me wheel sharply round on the varnished floor and to my bewilderment and terror i saw her sinking back in her chair pallid as death like one transfixedher jaw relaxed her poor little hands clasped her eyes expressive only of horror and woe and bent on something outside the window my gaze involuntarily followed hers as i sprung to her side at the railing before our little flowergarden stood a shabbylooking man whose face will ever haunt me his hat well worn tall and shiny was pressed knowingly over the right eye he was looking steadily at us and appeared as if he had been doing so for some time a diabolical grin like that of mephistopheles was over all his featuresin his carbunclelike eyes and in his wide mouth where all his teeth seemed to glisten he had a sallow and dissipated face a hooked sardonic nose and on his left cheek a large black mole a faded green dresscoat with brass buttons a yellow vest and short inexpressibles of checked stuff formed his attire my wife was almost fainting and seemed on the verge of distraction paquette my love i began but she held up her trembling hands as if deprecatingly between us and said in a low broken and wailing voice do not speak to medo not touch me i am not your wife oh my poor deluded carloh my poor heart oh death come and end this horrorthis mystery her words her voice her whole air and expression made my blood run cold with a sudden terror that her reason had become affected paquettedearest paquette i said in a soothing and an imploring manner what do these terrible words mean that man is monsieur baptiste graindorge my first husband come back from the grave to torment me impossiblegirl you rave said i in deep distress as i vaulted over the window and rushed out upon the road but the scurvy eavesdropper was gone and no trace of him remained in great grief and feeling sorely disturbed by the whole affair i returned to paquette whom i found crouching on the sofa crushed by agitation and despair she gazed at me lovingly sorrowfully and yet as if fearful that i might approach and touch her is there not some terrible mistake or misconception in this said i seeking to gather courage from my own words nonenone she replied i recognized too surely his facethe molethe odious smile but the man died in africait is impossible and you are my wife paquette whom none can take from me i continued with excited utterance as she permitted me to kiss her but the poor little pet was cold as marble and her tremulous hands played almost fatuously yet caressingly with my hair while she murmured oh carlmy poor carlwhat will become of us now the whole affair seemed too improbable for realization i besought her to take courageto consider the likeness which had startled her as a mere fancyan optical delusion and aware that my presence was imperatively necessary at business in the city i was compelled to leave her and did so not without a sorrowful foreboding so strong was the latter emotion that the closing of the housedoor rang like a knell in my heart i paused irresolute at the garden gate and again on the road but the jingling bells of the approaching sporvei bus ended my doubts i sprang in and in due time found myself at my office in the busy admiralitatstrasse opposite the rath haus haunted by the strange episode of the morning i strove vainly to become absorbed in bills of lading and so forth till one oclock should toll from the spiresthe time for plunging into the crowd of noisy speculators at the bourseand i was just about to set forth when a stranger was announced i looked up and was face to face with the horrible graindorge he stood before me just as i had seen him at the gardenrail with his tall shiny hat his shabby coat his bloated visage with its black mole and malignant smile your business i asked curtly will be briefly stated herr steinmetz said he so madame fully recognized me this morning or thought she did said i after a short interval of silence there was no doubt in the matter but firm conviction i did not die in senegal the report was false and so herr steinmetz i am here to claim my wife and take her back with me to lorraine you are a foul impostor cried i furiously yet with a sinking heart and i shall hand you over to the watch pardon me but you will do nothing of the kind replied the other with the most exasperating composure it will not be pleasant to have your wifeyour supposed wife i meanmade a source of speculation to all hamburg by any public exposé oh my god my poor paquette i exclaimed involuntarily and i love her so milles diables grinned the frenchman it is more than i do wretch what proof have we that you are baptiste graindorge and not a cheata trickster the effect produced by my presencemy appearanceon madame who dare not deny my identity which the gräfine spitzberger has already admittedwith great reluctance i grant you well i am supposed to be dead i shall be content to let this supposition remain and to quit hamburg for a consideration name it i asked thankful for the prospect of being rid of his horrid presence even for a time that i might consult some legal friend and yet even while i spoke and thought of purchasing his silence i knew that paquette my adored wife would be no wife of mine it was a horrible dilemma graindorge the lorrainer was rich now he seemed to be poor and needy i knew not what to think grief was uppermost in my soul after a pause he said slowly for six thousand prussian dollars i shall quit hamburg with a trembling hand yet without hesitation i wrote him a cheque on my banker herr berger in the graskeller for the sum named and the snaky eyes of the frenchman flashed as he clutched the document he inserted it in his tattered pocketbook and carefully buttoned his shabby green coat over it then he placed his hat jauntily on one side of his head and tapping the crown with his hand made me a low ironical bow and with a pirouette and a malicious smile quitted the room saying adieu monsieur steinmetzi go but for a time only chapter ii i saw the whole scheme now the bankruptfor such i had no doubt he wasmeant to make his power over paquette and me a source of future revenue to himself and i felt sure that when his last dollar was spentby tomorrow perhapshe would present himself again with a fresh demand like one in a dream i went to the bourse but little or no business was done there that day for war rumours were hourly growing more rife there were riots in its neighbourhood too the tradesmen were on strike and the swords of the watch had been busy for no less than seven unarmed men were cut down in the adolphsplatz then that evening i heard that a spy supposed to be a frenchman had been hovering about the northern ramparts near the damthor and had been seen to count the cannon on the holsteinwalla spy who had escaped alike the watch and the guard of the seventysixth regiment and whom i heard described as a shabby man in a green coat with a mole on his cheek my heart leaped within me could this personage and m baptiste graindorge be one and the same if so neither hamburg nor i was likely to be troubled by his presence again before my usual hour i hastened homehome to my pretty little villa among the rosetrees at blankenese but alas to find it desolate and our servant trüey a faithful young vierlander in tears and filled with wonder for her mistress had packed up some clothes and leaving all her jewels even to her weddingring had departed after writing a letter for me i tore it open and found it to contain but a few words to confirm my terror and fill up the cup of my misery the gräfine von spitzberger has been with me the man we saw is indeed my husband m graindorge the story of whose death has been all a mistake and he proved to her his identity by his knowledge of all our family affairs oh carl oh my poor darling the real husband of my heart and my only love i must leave youyesand by the time you read this shall be far on the railroad for france graindorge shall never see me more my fathers house or a convent must be my shelter now my last hope is that you will not attempt to follow me my last prayer that god may bless and comfort you the lines were written tremulously i kissed my darlings weddingring placed it by a ribbon at my neck and wept bitterly then the room seemed to swim around me i became senseless and was ill in bed for days our home was broken now it was desolateoh so desolate without my paquette she was gone she had left me for ever and every object around seemed to recall her more vividly to meher piano her music the little ornaments we had bought together at the alster arcade and the pillow her cheek had rested on she will write to me thought i but no letter came and something of jealousy began to mingle with the bitterness of my soul was she with graindorge i think i should have gone mad but for the events that occurred so quickly now for one week sufficed to change the whole face of affairs in hamburg france had declared war against prussia trade stood still silence reigned in our splendid bourse usually the most noisy and busy scene in the world the elbe was empty of shipping for its buoys and lights were all destroyed the prussians horse foot and artillery were pouring towards travemünde where a landing of the french was expected in one day nearly every horse in hamburg was seized for military purposes and the city was ordered to furnish eighteen thousand infantry for the landwehr of this force i was one a strip of paper was left at my office one day and the next noon saw me in the barracks near the damthorwall and before the colonel an officer of scottish descent the graf von hamilton then like thousands of others my plain clothes were taken from me and i received in lieu a spiked helmet of glazed leather a blue tunic faced with white a goatskin knapsack greatcoat and campkettle a needlegun bayonet and sword we were all accoutred without delay and within two hours were at drill under a burning sun in the heilinghaistfeld between hamburg and altona my desk my office my home knew me no more yet i often mounted guard near the chambers of our firm in the admiralitatstrasse paquette and my previous existence seemed all a dreama dream that had passed away for ever and though the gay streets the tall spires the sights and sounds in our pleasureloving city were all unchanged i seemed to have lost my identity my former life was completely blotted out from the landwehr with many others i was speedily drafted into the seventysixth hanoverians and in three weeks we were ordered to join the army of the rhine though i had studied in berlin i was not a prussian but a native of the free city of hamburg like many of my comrades who were fathers of families or only sons torn from their homes and peaceful occupations i had no interest in the cruel and wanton war on which we were about to enter and more than all i loved france for it was the native land of paquette champfleurie in the then horror of my mind the war was certainly somewhat of a change or relief and the excitement around drew me from my own terrible thoughts i was going towards lorraine where even while fighting against her poor countrymen i might see my lost one my wifefor such i still deemed her despite the odious baptiste graindorge and so i fondly and wildly speculated the idea of being killed and buried where paquette might perhaps pass near my grave was even soothing to my now morbid soul for i knew that she had loved me long before that man came between us with his wealth of gold napoleons so she must love me stillcarl whose heart had never wandered from her but there is something great and inspiring in war and its adjuncts after all i remember that on the day we left our beautiful hamburg when i heard the crash of the brass bands and saw the north german colours waving in the wind above the long long column of glazed helmets and bright bayonets as our regiment with the fortyseventh silesians the fiftythird westphalians and the eightyeighth nassauers defiled through the damthor and past the esplanade towards the bahnhof i became infected by the enthusiasm around me and found myself joining in the mad shouts of hurrah germania and in the old teutonic song which the advanced guard of uhlans struck up brandishing their lances the while o tannebaum o tannebaum wie grün sind deine blatter as we marched for the rhine towards which we were forwarded fast by road and rail we were soon face to face with the gallant french and how fast those terrible battles followed each other at weissenburg forbach spicheren and elsewhere the public prints have already most fully related though i did not seek death any more than others my comrades i cared little for life yet until one night in october i escaped in all three of those bloody conflicts and many a daily skirmish without a wound though the chassepot balls whistled thickly round me and more than once the fire of a mitrailleuse a veritable stream of bullets swept away whole sections by my side i have had my uniform riddled with holes my helmet grazed many times and part of my knapsack shot away yet somehow fate always spared poor carl steinmetz for he had no enmity in his heart towards the poor fellows who fell before his needlegun at last we rapidly pushed on and reduced many fortified places as we advanced to blockade metz then lorraine lay around us and i gazed on the scenery with emotions peculiarly my own for i thought of paquette of her animated face and all her pretty ways and of all she had told me of her native province its dense forests where wolves lurked its wild mountains its salt springs and lakeslorraine now as in centuries long past a subject for dispute between france and germany the seventysixth under the graf von hamilton formed part of the army which under prince frederick carl blockaded metz with such cruel success and we had severe work in the wet nights of october while forming the feldwacht in the advanced riflepits often when lying there alone in the damp hole behind a sandbag or saproller waiting for a chance shot in the early dawn at some unfortunate frenchman i thought bitterly and sadly of our once happy home of paquette my lost wife and wondered where she was now or if when she saw the prussian columns with all their brightpolished barrels and spiked helmets shining in the sun she could dream that i carl steinmetz was a unit in that mighty host then i would marvel in my heart whether i with the spiked helmet and needlegun loaded with accoutrements and spattered with mud was the same carl steinmetz who but a few months before sat daily at his desk in the admiralitatstrasse and had the sweet smiles of paquette to welcome him home and listen to his news from the bourse was this military transformation madness or witchcraft it was neither but stern reality as an unexpected shot from a hedge about four hundred yards distant tore the brass eagle from my helmet and fully informed me this was just about daybreak on the morning of the 26th october last and when i could see all the village quarters from marslatour to mazières lit up and all the bivouac fires burning redly on our left and in the rear with a few others i started from the riflepits and we made a dash at the hedge which we believed to conceal some of those francstireurs whom we had orders to shoot without mercy though they were only fighting for home and country we were on the extreme flank of the blockading force and the hedge in question surrounded a villa which stood somewhat apart from the road to château salins led by the grafs son a young captain we rushed forward and found it manned by some fifty men of the french line who had crept out of metz intending to desert for bazaine permitted them to do so when provisions began to fail a bas les pruessiens cried their leadera tall subofficer in very tattered uniformthus accentuating the word in the excess of his hatred vorwartsfür vaterlandhurrah germania shouted the young von hamilton a volley that killed ten of our number tore among us but we broke through and fell upon them with the bayonet clubbing his chassepot the french sousofficier with a yell on his lips beat down poor hamilton then he rushed upon me and what was my emotionwhat my astonishment to find myself face to face with graindorgehe who had robbed me of paquettethe same beerbloated and scurvylooking fellow with the huge black mole whom i had last seen in hamburg i charged him with my bayonet breast high but agitation so bewildered me that he easily eluded my point and felled me to the earth with his clubbed rifle now came a sense of confusion of light flashing from my eyes the clash of steel the ping of passing balls then darkness seemed to envelop me and death to enter my heart as i became senseless i remained long thus for the sun was in the west when full consciousness returned the thick leather helmet had saved my head from fracture but dried blood plastered all my face and i found my right arm broken by a bullet all the french in the rear of the hedge had been shot down or bayoneted and they presented a terrible spectacle all were dead save onethe sousofficier who lay near me dying of many bayonet wounds our wounded had been removed but ten of the seventysixth lay near me stiff and cold what a scene it was in that pretty garden amid the rosetrees the last flowers of autumn and the twittering sparrows to see all those poor fellows made in gods fair image butchered thusand for what my wounds were sore my heart was sad and heavy oh when was it otherwise now staggering up i turned to the frenchman whose halfglazing eyes regarded me with a fiercely defiant expression for he doubted not that in this guerre à la mort his last moment had come i took off my battered helmet and then with a thrill of terror he seemed to recognize me carl steinmetz of hamburg said he with difficulty you know me then i asked grimly oh yesin gods name give me wateri am dying my canteen was empty but i found some wine in that of a corpse which lay near i poured it down his throat and it partially revived him yes fellow said i in me you see that steinmetz who was so happy till you came and my wife fled so we know each other monsieur baptiste graindorge i am not baptistehe is lying quiet in his grave on the shore of the senegal river who in the name of heaven are you achille graindorgehis cousin i took advantage of our casual but strong resemblance to impose upon youandand get moneywhen in hamburgacting as a spyeh yes has shehas paquette seen you since nofor she would at once have detected the cheat and you know not where she is as i have heaven soon to answerno he gasped out and sinking back shortly after expired his last breath seeming to issue from the wounds in his chest i had no pity for him but felt a glow of joy in my heart as i turned away and creptfor i was unable to standtowards the door of the villa in search of succour the agony of my thirst and wounds being so great that i cared little whether the inmates aided or killed me however the coincidences of this day were not yet over the door on which i struck feebly with my short prussian sword was opened ultimately by an old gentleman beyond whom i saw a female shrinking back in evident terror i recognized m de champfleurie my fatherinlaw but being now unable to speak i could only point to my parched lips and powerless arm as i sank at his feet and fainted when i recovered my uniform was open my accoutrements were off i was lying upon a sofa with my aching head pillowed softlyon whatthe tender bosom of paquette my darling little wife for she had recognized me though disguised alike by dress and blood and now her tears were falling on my weatherbeaten face it chanced that flying from place to place in lorraine before our advancing troops and having failed to reach metz they had taken shelter in that abandoned villa and thus happily i could reveal the secret of our separation before the burial party bore away the body of achille graindorge who had actually been quartered at senegal when his cousin baptiste died there my story is told on the following day metz capitulated and poor m champfleurie danced with rage on learning that bazaine had surrendered with two other marshals of the empire 173000 prisoners and 20000 sick wounded and starving men my fighting days were over now paquette was restored to me and happiness was again before us for their kindness in succouring me the graf von hamilton gave m de champfleurie and his daughter a pass to the rear and we speedily availed ourselves of it for i was discharged with a shattered arm and now i write these lines again in pleasant blankenese our dear home with the broad elbe shining blue beneath our windows and the autumn leaves falling fast from the thick woods that cover all its green and beautiful shore apparitions and wonders chapter i leaves

three distinct occasions the bass rock has assumed to the eyes of the crowds upon the sands of dunbar the form of a giant sugarloaf crowned by battlements while the island of may seemed broken into several portions which appeared to be perforated by caverns where none in fact exist such optical delusions have been common at all times in certain states of the atmosphere and science finds a ready solution for them but in the days of our forefathers they were deemed the sure precursors of dire calamities invasion or pestilence the years shortly before and after the beginning of the last century seem to have been singularly fruitful in the marvellous and the most superstitious celtic peasant in the scottish glens or the wilds of connemara would not have believed in more startling events than those which are chronicled in the occasional broadsides and were hawked about the streets of london by the flying stationers of those days to take a few of these at random we find that all london was excited by strange news from goeree in holland where on the evening of the 14th of august 1664 there was seen by many spectators an apparition of two fleets upon the ocean these after seeming to engage in close battle for one hour and a half the smoke of the noiseless cannon rolling from their sides vanished as if shown from a magiclantern then appeared in the air two lions or the figures thereof which fought three times with great fury till there came a third of greater size which destroyed them both immediately after this there came slowly athwart the sky as represented in the woodcut which surmounted this veracious broadsheet the giant figure of a crowned king this form was seen so plainly that the buttons on his dress could be distinguished by the awestricken crowd assembled on the sands next morning the same apparition was seen again and all the ocean was as red as blood and this happening at this juncture of time concludes the narrator begets some strange apprehensions for that about six months before van tromp was slain in war with england there was seen near the same place an apparition of ships in the air fighting with each other  london printed by thomas leach shoe lane 1664 sixteen years later another broadsheet announced to the metropolis that the forms of ships and men also had been seen on the road near abington on the 26th of august 1680 of the truth whereof you may be fully satisfied at the sarazens head inn carter lane it would seem that john nibb a very sober fellow the carrier of cirencester with five passengers in his waggon all proceeding to london about a quarter of an hour after sunrise were horrified to perceive at the far horizon the giant figure of a man in a black habit and armed with a broadsword towering into the sky like the spectre of the brocken this faded away but to add to the bewilderment of nibb and his companions it was replaced by about a hundred ships of several bigness and various shapes then rose a great hill covered with little villages and before it spread a plain on which rode thirty horsemen armed with carbine and pistol the same document records that on the 12th of the subsequent september a naval engagement was seen in the air near porsnet in monmouthshire between two fleets one of which came from the northern quarter of the sky the other from the south a great ship fired first and after her the rest discharged their vollies in order so that great flashings of fire and even smoak was visible and noises in the ayr as of great guns then an army of phantoms engaged in a square medow near porsnet closing in with sword and pistol and the cries of the wounded and dying were heard on the 27th of december ottery near exeter had a visitation of the same kind when at five in the evening two armies fought in the air till six oclock this was seen by a reverend minister and several others to their great amazement on the 2nd of the same month the people in shropshire were according to another sheet sorely perplexed by the sudden appearance of two suns in the firmament and it was duly remembered that such a sign was seen before the death of that tempestuous firebrand of rome here in england thomas beckett archbishop of canterbury and when queen mary began her bloody reign then follow the death of the three lions in the tower and a vast enumeration of fiery darts

hospital gate 1681 nor were ghosts wanting at this time of a political nature too for in the same year there was hawked in london an account of an apparition which appeared three several times to elizabeth freeman thirtyone years of age on each occasion delivering a message to his sacred majesty king charles the second as certified before sir joseph jorden knight and richard lee dd rector of hatfield her story was as follows and was no doubt a political trick on the night of the 24th of january 1680 she was sitting at her mothers fireside with a child on her knee when a solemn voice behind her said sweetheart and on turning she was startled to perceive a veiled woman all in white whose face was concealed and whose handa pale and ghastly onerested on the back of her chair the 15th day of may is appointed for the royal blood to be poisoned said the figure be not afraid for i am only sent to tell thee it added and straightway vanished on tuesday the 25th of january the same figure met her at the house door and asked elizabeth if she remembered the message but the woman instead of replying exclaimed in the name of the father son and holy ghost what art thou upon this the figure assumed a very glorious shape and saying tell king charles from me not to remove his parliament but stand to his council vanished as before next evening the veiled figure appeared again when elizabeth was with her mother who on beholding her daughters manifest terror said dost thou see anything she was then warned to retire after which the spectre said sternly do your message i shall if god enable me replied elizabeth after this the spectre appeared but once again and remained silent this was taken from the maids own mouth by me richard wilkinson schoolmaster in the said town of

and wonderful news from cornwall being an account of a miraculous accident which happened near the town of bodmyn at a place called park printed by j wallis white fryars gatenext fleet stnear the joyners shop from this it would appear that on sunday the 8th of may jacob mutton whose relations were of good repute and who was servant to william hicks rector of cordingham at a house he had near the old parish church of eglashayle called park heard on going into his chamber about eight oclock in the evening a hollow voice cry so hoe so hoe so hoe this drew him to the window of the next room from whence to the terror of a lad who shared his bed he disappeared and could nowhere be found according to his own narrative he had no sooner laid a hand upon an iron bar of the window which was seventeen feet from the ground than the whole grating fell into the yard below all save the bar which he had grasped this bar was discovered in his hand next morning as he lay asleep in a narrow lane beyond the little town of stratton among the hills thirty miles distant from park there he was wakened by the earliest goers to stratton fair who sent him home sorely bewildered by the way of camelford on tuesday he returned to his masters estate without any hurt but very melancholy saying that a tall man bore him company all the journey over hedges and brakes yet without weariness what became of this mysterious man he knew not neither had he any memory of how the iron bar came to be in his hand to conclude the young man who is the occasion of this wonderful relation was never before this accident accounted any ways inclinable to sadness but on the contrary was esteemed an airy brisk and honest young fellow but muttons adventure was a joke when compared with that of mr jacob seeley of exeter as he related it to the judges on the western circuit when on the 22nd of september 1690 he was beset by a veritable crowd of dreadful spectres he took horse for taunton in somersetshire by the hinton cliff road on which he had to pass a solitary place known as the black down prior to this he halted at a town called cleston where the coach and waggons usually tarried and there he had some roast beef with a tankard of beer and a noggin of brandy in company with a stranger who looked like a farmer and who rode by his side for three miles till they reached the black down when he suddenly vanished into the earth or air to the great perplexity of mr jacob seeley this emotion was rather increased when he found himself surrounded by from one to two hundred spectres attired as judges magistrates and peasantry the latter armed with pikes but gathering courage he hewed at them with his sword though they threw over his head something like a fishingnet in which they retained him from nine at night till four next morning he thrust at the shadows with his rapier but he felt nothing till he saw one was cut and had four of his fingers hanging by the skin and then he found blood upon his sword after this ten spectre funerals passed then two dead bodies were dragged near him by the hair of the head and other horrors succeeded till the spell broke at cockcrow it was now remembered that the house wherein mr seeley had his beef beer and brandy had been kept by one of monmouths men the spectre farmer probably who had been hung on his own signpost and the piece of ground where the net confined the traveller was a place where maay of the hapless dukes adherents had been executed and interred hence it was named the black down according to the sheet before us which was printed for t m london 2nd oct 1690 a sheet circulated at the close of the preceding year warns all hypocrites and atheists to beware in time as there had been a dreadful tempest of thunder and lightning in hants at alton where the atmosphere became so obscure that the electric flashes alone lighted the church during the service in which two balls of fire passed through its eastern wall another tore the steeple to pieces broke the clock to shreds and bore away the weathercock the narrator adds that all friesland was under water and that a flood in the tiber had swept away a portion of the castle of st angelo as another warning london was visited in 1689 by a tempest which uprooted sixtyfive trees in st jamess park and moorfields blew down the vane of st michaels church in cornhill and innumerable chimneys and injured many wellbuilt houses and part of the armourers hall in coleman street several persons were killed in gravel lane and shoreditch sixty empty boats were dashed to pieces against the bridge three gravesend barges full of people were cast away and the crown manofwar was stranded at woolwich  printed for w f bishopgate without but the warning seems to have been in vain for london in 1692 was treated to an earthquake whichas another sheet recordsspread terror and astonishment about the royal exchange all along cornhill in lothbury and elsewhere on the 8th of september all things on shelves were cast down and furniture was tossed from wall to wall the spitalfields weavers had to seek shelter in flight and all their looms were destroyed these and other calamities were it was alleged occasioned by the sins of the nation and to avert such prodigies the prayers of all good men were invoked  j gerard cornhill 1692 two years later saw another marvel when the dumb maid of wapping sarah bowers recovered her power of speech through the prayers of messrs russell and veil two pious divines who exorcised and expelled the evil spirit which possessed her and in 1696 the metropolis was treated to the detection of a popish cheat concerning two boys who conversed with the devil though none seemed to doubt the protestant miracle the close of the century 1700 saw the dark and hellish powers of witchcraft exercised upon the reverend mr wood minister of bodmyn on whom a spell was cast by a mysterious paper or written document which was given to him by a man and woman on horseback the latter probably seated on a pillion after which he became strangely disordered and wandered about in fields meadows woods and lonely places drenched the while with copious perspirations however the spell was ultimately found in his doublet and on the burning thereof mr wood was perfectly restored and wrote to his uncle an account of the affair which appeared in a broadsheet published at exeter by darker and farley 1700 rosemary lane was the scene of another wonder when a notorious witch was found in a garret there and carried before justice bateman in well close on the 23rd july 1704 and committed to clerkenwell prison her neighbours children through her alleged diabolical power vomited pins and were terrified by apparitions of enormous cats by uttering one word she turned the entire contents of a large shop topsyturvy she was judicially tossed into the river from a duckingstool but like a bladder when put under water she popped up again for this witch swam like a cork this was an indisputable sign of guilt and in her rage or terror she smote a young man on the arm where the mark of her hand remained as black as coal he died soon after in agony and was buried in st sepulchres churchyard of the womans ultimate fate we know nothing  h hills in the blackfriars near the waterside in 1705 london was excited by a new affair the female ghost and wonderful discovery of an iron chest of money a rare example of the gullibility of people in the days of the good queen anne a certain madam maybel who had several houses in rosemary lane lost them by unlucky suits and unjust decrees of the law for a time they were tenantless and fell to decay and ruin for several weeks nay months past continues the broadsheet a strange apparition appeared nightly to a mrs harvey and her sister near relations of the late madam maybel announcing that an iron chest filled with treasure lay in a certain part of one of the old houses in the lane on their neglecting to heed the vision the ghost became more importunate and proceeded to threaten mrs harvey that if she did not cause it to be digged up in a certain time naming it she should be torn to pieces on this the terrified gentlewoman sought the counsel of a minister who advised her to demand in the name of the holy trinity how the said treasure should be disposed of next night she questioned the spectre and it replied fear nothing but take the whole four thousand pounds into your own possession and when you have paid twenty pounds of it to one sarah goodwin of tower hill the rest is your own and be sure you dig it up on the night of thursday the 7th december accordingly men were set to work and certainly a great iron chest was found under an old wall in the very place which the spirit had described one of the diggers john fishpool a private of the guards has been under examination about it and tis thought that the gentleman who owns the ground will claim the treasure as his right and tis thought there will be a suit of law commenced on it many persons crowded to see the hole from whence the chest had been exhumed in rosemary lane and by a date upon the lid it would seem to have been made or concealed in the ninth year of the reign of henry the eighth  london printed for john green near the exchange 1705 the dreadful effects of going to conjurers next occupied the mind of the public mr rowland rushway a gentleman of good reputation having lost money and plate to a considerable amount hester his wife took god to witness that if all the cunning men in london could tell she should discover the thief though it cost her ten pounds with this view she repaired to the house of a judicial astrologer in moorfields about noon when the day was one of great serenity and beauty after some preliminary mummery or trickery the wizard placed before her a large mirror wherein she saw gradually appear certain indistinct things which ultimately assumed the full proportion of one man and two women these are the persons who stole your property said the astrologer do you know them no she replied then quoth he you will never have your goods again she paid him and retired but had not gone three roods from the house when the air became darkened the serene sky was suddenly overcast and there swept through the streets a dreadful tempest of wind and rain done as she alleged by this cunning man satans agent with diabolical black art forcing her to take shelter in an alehouse to escape its fury many chairmen and market folks were all cognizant of this storm which was confined to the vicinity of the alehouse and a portion of the adjacent river where many boats were cast away and the skirt of it would seem to have visited grays inn walk where three stately trees were uprooted chapter ii the wild beast of gevaudan in the year 1765 the french dutch and brussels papers teemed with marvellous accounts of a monstrous creature called the wild beast of gévaudan whose ravages for a time spread terror and even despair among the peasantry of provence and languedoc especially in those districts of the ancient narbonne gaul which were mountainous woody and cold and where communication was rendered difficult by the want of good roads and navigable rivers in the april of that year a drawing of this animal was sent to the intendant of alençon entitled figure de la beste sic feroce lou nomme lhyene qui a devoré plus que 80 personnes dans le gévaudan an engraving of this is now before us and certainly its circulation must have added to the confusion of the nature of the original this print represents the beast with a huge head large eyes a long tongue a double row of sharp fangs small and erect ears like those of a cat the paws and body of a lion with the tail of a cow which trails on the ground with a bushy tuft at the end  the history of france records that there appeared a wild beast in the forest of fontainebleau in 1653 which devoured one hundred and forty persons before it was killed by twelve mousquetaires of the royal guards in december 1764 it first made its appearance at st flour in provence and on the 20th it devoured a little girl who was herding cattle near mende a detachment of light dragoons sent in search of it hunted in vain for six weeks the wild and mountainous parts of languedoc though a thousand crowns were offered by the province of mende to any person who would slay it and public prayers were put up in all the churches for deliverance from this singular scourge which soon became so great a terror to those districts as ever the dragon was of which we read in the seven champions of christendom no two accounts tallied as to the appearance of this animal and some of these doubtless the offspring of the terror and superstition of the peasantry added greatly to the dread it inspired french hyperbole was not wanting and the gazettes were filled with the most singular exaggerations and gasconades the groves of olive and mulberry trees and the vineyards were neglected the woodcutters abandoned the forests and hence fuel became provokingly dear even in paris in the month of january we are told that it devoured a great many persons chiefly children and young girls it was said by those who escaped to be larger than a wolf but that previous to springing on its victim by crouching on the ground it seemed no longer than a fox at the distance of one or two fathoms it rises on its hind legs and leaps upon its prey which it seizes by the neck or throat but is afraid of horned cattle from which it runs away it was alleged by some to be the cub of a tiger and lioness by others of a panther and hyena which had escaped from a private menagerie belonging to victor amadeus duke of savoy a peasant of marvejols who wounded it by a musket shot found a handful of its hair which stank very much he averred it to be the bigness of a yearold calf the head a foot in length the chest large as that of a horse his howling in the night resembled the braying of an ass according to collated statements the beast was seen within the same hour at different places in one instance twentyfour miles apart hence many persons naturally maintained that there were two on the 27th december 1764 a young woman in her nineteenth year was torn to pieces by it at bounesal near mende next day it appeared in the wood of st martin de born and was about to spring upon a girl of twelve years when her father rushed to her protection the woodman a bold and hardy fellow rendered desperate by the danger of his child kept it at bay for a quarter of an hour the beast all the while endeavouring to fly at the girl and they would both inevitably have become its prey if some horned cattle which the father kept in the wood had not fortunately come up on which the beast was terrified and ran away this account was attested on oath by the woodman before the mayor and other civil authorities of mende an episcopal city in languedoc on the 9th of january an entire troop of the 10th light horse the volontaires etrangers de clermontprince then stationed at st chely was despatched under captain duhamel in quest of the animal which had just torn and disembowelled a man midway between their quarters and la garge on this occasion the bishop of mende said a solemn mass and the consecrated host was elevated in the cathedral which was thronged by the devout for the entire day but the beast still defied all efforts for his capture or destruction and soon after in the wood of st colme four leagues from rhodez it devoured a shepherdess of eighteen years of age celebrated for her beauty the english papers began to treat the affair of the wild beast as a jest or allegory invented by the jesuits to render the protestants odious and absurd as it was said to have escaped from the duke of savoys collection and this circumstance is designed says one journal to point out the protestants who are supposed to derive their principles from the ancient waldensee who inhabited the valleys of piedmont and were the earliest promoters of the reformation a writer in a scottish newspaper of the period goes still farther and announces his firm belief that this tormentor of the gévaudanois was nothing more or less than the wild beast prophesied in the apocalypse of st john whereon the scarlet lady was mounted another asserts that it was typical of the whole romish clergy and that its voracious appetite answered to another part of scripture conceived in the words eating up my people as they eat breadhis favourite food being generally little boys and girls of protestant parentage  edinburgh advertiser 1764 after a long and fruitless chase captain duhamel before returning to quarters at st chely resolved to make a vigorous attempt to destroy this mysterious scourge of languedoc but his extreme ardour caused his plans to miscarry posting his volontaires some on horseback and some on foot at all the avenues of a wood to which it had been traced it was soon roused from its lair by the explosion of pistols and sound of trumpets there was a cry raised of voilà gardez labête and duhamel an officer of great courage who had dismounted rushed forward to assail it sword in hand but had the mortification to see it with a terrible roar spring past the very place he had just quitted two of his dragoons fired their pistols but both missed they then pursued it on the spur for nearly a league and though seldom more than four or five paces from it they were unable to cut it down and ultimately it escaped by leaping a high stone wall which their horses were unable to surmount and after crossing a marsh which lay on the other side it leisurely retired to a wild forest beyond the baffled dragoons reported that it was as big as the largest park dog very shaggy of a brown colour a yellow belly a very large head and had two very long tusks ears short and erect and a branched tail which it sets up very much when running fear had no share in this strange description for the officers of clermonts regiment asserted that the two dragoons were as brave men as any in the corps but some declared that it was a bear and others a wild boar on the 12th of january it attacked seven children five boys and two girls who were at play near the mountain of marguerite it tore the entire cheek off one boy and gobbled it up before him but the other four led by a boy named portefaix having stakes shod with iron drove the beast into a marsh where it sunk up to the belly and then disappeared that night a boys body was found half devoured in the neighbourhood of st marcel on the 21st it severely lacerated a girl and according to the paris gazette next day attacked a woman and bit off her head the four brave boys who put it to flight received a handsome gratuity from the bishop of mende and by the kings order were educated for the army the gazette adds that the king gave the young portefaix a gift of four hundred livres and three hundred to each of his companions as females and little ones seemed the favourite food of the beast captain duhamel now ordered several of his dragoons to dress themselves as women and with their pistols and fusils concealed to accompany the children who watched the cattle and the king of france now offered from his privy purse two thousand crowns in addition to the one thousand offered by the province of mende for the head of this terrible animal inspired by a hope of winning the proffered reward a stout and hardy peasant of languedoc armed with a good musket set out in search of it but on beholding the beast suddenly near him surrounded by all the real and imaginary terrors it inspired he forgot alike his musket and his resolution he shrieked with terror and fled and soon after the creature devoured a woman of the village of jullange at the foot of the mountain of marguerite as the terror was increasing in gévaudan and the vivarez the offered rewards were again increased to no less than ten thousand livres by the diocese of mende two thousand by the province of languedoc two thousand by the king six thousand and the following placard was posted up in all the towns and cities of the adjacent provinces by order of the king and the intendant of the province of languedoc notice is given to all persons that his majesty being deeply affected by the situation of his subjects now exposed to the ravages of the wild beast which for four months past has infested vivarez and gévaudan and being desirous to stop the progress of such a calamity has determined to promise a reward of six thousand livres to any person or persons who shall kill the animal such as are willing to undertake the pursuit of him may previously apply to the sieur de la font subdeputy to the intendant of mende who will give them the necessary instructions agreeable to what has been prescribed by the ministry on the part of his majesty still the ubiquitous beast remained untaken and a letter from paris of the 13th february relates the terror it occasioned to a party consisting of m le tivre a councillor and two young ladies who were on their way to visit m de sante the curé of vaisour they were travelling in a berlingo drawn by four posthorses with two postilions and accompanied by a footman who rode a saddlehorse and was armed with a sabre the first night on approaching the dreaded district they halted at guimpe and next morning at nine oclock set forth intending to lunch at roteaux a village situated in a bleak and mountainous place the bailiff of guimpe deemed it his duty to warn them as strangers that the wild beast had been often seen lurking about the chaussée that week and that it would be proper to take an escort of armed men for their protection m le tivre and the councillor being foolhardy declined and took the young ladies under their own protection but they had scarcely proceeded two leagues when they perceived a postchaise attended by an outrider coming down the rugged road that traversed the hill of credi at a frightful pace and pursued by the wild beast the leading horse fell on which the terrible pursuer made a spring towards it but m le tivres footman interposed with his drawn sabre on which the beast pricked up its ears stood erect and showed its fangs and mouth full of froth whisked round and gave the terrified valet a blow with its tail covering all his face with blood the rest of the narrative is ridiculously incredible for it states that on perceiving a gentleman levelling a blunderbuss which flashed in the pan the beast darted right through the chaise of m le tivre smashing the side glasses and escaped to the wood the stench left in the shattered chaise was past description and no burning of frankincense or other method removed it so that it was sold for two louis and though burned to ashes the cinders were obliged by order of the commissary to be buried without the town walls advertiser 1765 eluding the many armed hunters who were now in pursuit of it in the early part of february the wild beast was seen hovering in wellfrequented places on the skirts of the forests adjoining the fields and vineyards in the hamlets and on the highways in janols the capital of gévaudanois it sprang upon a child whose cries brought his father to his aid but ere a rescue could be effected the poor little creature was rent asunder three days afterwards on the feast of the purification five peasants going to mass at reintort de randon suddenly perceived it on the highway before them it was crouching and about to spring when their shouts and the pointed staves with which they were armed put it to flight on sunday the 3rd february it was heard howling in the little village of st amans during the celebration of high mass all the inhabitants were in church but as they had taken the precaution to shut up the children in their houses it retired without doing any mischief on the 8th it was perceived within a hundred yards of the town of aumont a general chase through the snow was made by the armed huntsmen but night came on before they came within range of the dreaded fugitive in february and march we find it still continuing its ravages through all the pleasant valleys of the aisne at soissons it worried a woman to death and partly devoured her two girls were brought to the hospital of st flour in a dying state from wounds it had inflicted catherine boyer aged twenty years who was attacked on the 15th of january at bastidedemontfort all that part of the head on which the hair grew is torn away with a part of the os coronæ and the whole pericranium with the upper part of the ear is lost the occipital bone is likewise laid bare the other girl belongs to st just the left side of her head and neck is carried away with part of her nose and upper lip on the 1st of march a man boldly charged it on horseback but was thrown and leaving his nag to its mercy scrambled away and found refuge in a mill where it besieged him for some time till a lad of seventeen appeared whom it lacerated with teeth and claws and left expiring outside the door on the road near bazoches it tore to pieces a woman who attempted to save a girl on which it was about to spring and four men of that place armed with loaded guns watched all night near the mangled body in the hope that it might return but the animal was several miles distant and after biting several sheep and cows in a farmyard was at last severely wounded by antoine savanelle an old soldier who assailed it with a pitchfork which he thrust into its throat and he was vain enough to declare that the wound was mortal and that he must have killed it this boast however was premature for it soon reappeared biting tearing and devouring and though a man of malzieu wounded it by a musket shot making it roll over with a hideous cry it was able on the 9th to drag a child for two hundred yards from a cottage door it dropped its prey unhurt but on the same evening we are told that it partly devoured a young woman near the village of miolonettes and committed other ravages the mere enumeration of which would weary rather than astonish though it was stated that not less than twenty thousand men a sad exaggeration surely noblesse hunters woodmen and soldiers were in pursuit of it under the count de morangies an old maréchal de camp who passed a whole night near the body of the halfdevoured girl in the vain hope that the monster would return within range of his musket great astonishment and ridicule were excited in england by these continued details and under date of 13th march a pretended letter from paris headed wonderful intelligence went the round of the press the wild beast that makes such a noise all over europe and after whom there are at least thirty thousand regular forces and seventy thousand militia and armed peasants proves to be a descendant on the mothers side from the famous dragon of wantley and on the fathers side from a scotch highland laird he eats a house as an alderman eats a custard and with the wag of his tail he throws down a church he was attacked on the night of the 8th instant in his den by a detachment of fourteen thousand men under the command of duc de valliant but the platoon firing and even the artillery had only the effect of making him sneeze at last he gave a slash with his tail by which we lost seven thousand men then making a jump over the left wing made his escape elsewhere we findyesterday about ten in the morning a courier arrived in london from france with the melancholy news that the wild beast had on the 25th instant been attacked by the whole french army consisting of one hundred and twenty thousand men whom he totally defeated in the twinkling of an eye swallowing the whole train of artillery and devouring twentyfive thousand men but still in languedoc lovers who had lost their brides brothers their sisters and parents their children armed with guns and spears beat the mountain sides and wild thickets for this animal the existence of which was considered nearly or quite fabulous in london it would seem to have been deemed so in holland too for the utrecht gazette after detailing how bravely a poor woman of la bessiere name jane chaston defended her little children against the beast which appeared in her garden and tore one with its teeth states that whatever scoffers might say its existence was no longer doubtful adding that unless we believe in the accounts of it which come from france we must reject the greatest part of the events to which we give credit as being of much less authority louis xv gave a handsome gratuity to jane chaston for her courage and tenderness in defending her children but we are not informed how or with what she was armed the duc de praslin received a report from the comte de montargis who commanded the troops in the neighbourhood of la bessiere to the effect that three days after the adventure of jane chaston a party of eighty dragoons en route to join their regiment fell in with the beast and rode at full speed towards it when first discovered it was one hundred and fifty yards distant and fled into a hollow place which was environed by marshes and water and then they endeavoured to hunt it forth by dogs they opened a fire upon it with their carbines but as the rain was falling in torrents all these flashed in the pan save one which went off without effect the rain continues the report which is not very flattering to m le comtes cavalry not only hindered aid from coming to the troopers the explosion of the carbine and their incessant cries of the beast the beast having alarmed the whole neighbourhood but by filling up the hollows with water made them unable any longer threequarters of an hour after this the beast appeared in a field where tiles were made at the base of mount mimat where there is a hermitage dedicated to st privat partly hewn out of the rock this was then inhabited by an aged recluse and an officer of artillery a reformed roué who had dwelt with him for eighteen months by way of penance from the window they could plainly see the beast gambolling playfully on the grass and climbing up the trees like a squirrel but being without arms they shut and made fast the door of the grotto near which it remained watching for half an hour this time the officer employed in making a sketch of it which next day he sent to the bishop of mende and here perhaps we have the startling engraving which was produced by the intendant of alençon the comte de montargis forwarded this sketch to the duc de praslin to whose office the people flocked in multitudes to behold it but public opinion was divided as to whether the animal was a lynx or a bear but i am certain adds the writer of the news that if it was brought to the fair of st germain it would draw more spectators than the famous indian bird this celebrated fair was then held in a large meadow contiguous to the ancient abbey of st germaindesprés and was the grand rendezvous of all the dissipated society of paris to whom its gamingtables booths theatres cafes cabarets formed a neverending source of attraction in april the beast devoured a young woman of twenty who was watching some cattle after that event the country became quite deserted though its preference for the fair sex seemed very decided no men would work in the fields herd the flocks or go abroad save in armed bands the brussels gazette of may records a new phase in the history of the beast of eighteen persons whom it had bitten thirteen are stated to have died raving mad one patient began to howl like a dog on which he was bled copiously and chained hand and foot endued with terrible strength he burst his bonds and raved about in wild frenzy destroying everything that came in his way until he was shot down by an officer with a doublebarrelled gun when attempting with a crowbar to break into a countryhouse near broine where thirty persons had taken refuge from him about six in the evening of the 1st of may the sieur martel de la chaumette whose château was at st albans in the bishopric of mende perceived from a window an animal which he was certain could be no other than the wild beast of gévaudan it was in a grass meadow seated on its hind legs and was gazing steadfastly at a lad about fifteen years of age who was herding some horned cattle and was all unaware of its vicinity and ulterior views the sieur de la chaumette summoned his two brothers and armed with guns they issued forth in pursuit of the animal which fled at their approach the youngest overtook it in the forest and put a ball into it at sixtyseven paces it rolled over three times which enabled the elder chaumette to put in another ball at fiftytwo paces on which it fled and escaped losing blood in great quantities night came on and the pursuit was abandoned but next day the chaumettes were joined by the sieurs dennival father and son and a band of hunters its trail and traces of blood were found and followed for a great distance but they tracked it in vain the sieur de la chaumette who had slain a great many wolves declared that the animal he had seen in the meadow was not one but his description of its appearance coincided exactly with that given by the sieur duhamel of the 10th light horse and with the sketch made by the military hermit of st privat the chaumettes were in great hopes that the two bullets had slain the monster but on the day following at five in the evening at a spot five leagues distant from the château it devoured a girl fourteen years of age and the terror of the people increased as the beast seemed to have a charmed life and to be almost bulletproof the picked marksmen of fifty parishes now joined in the chase two remarkably fine dogs of the sieur dennival were so eager in the pursuit that they left the hunt far behind and as they were never seen again were supposed to have been killed and eaten the society of the knights of st hubert in the city of puy composed of forty men joined in the crusade against this denizen of the wilds of languedoc but it was not until the end of september 1765 that it was ultimately vanquished and slain by a gamekeeper and the sieur antoine de bauterne a gentleman of paris who set out for gévaudan on purpose to encounter it after a long arduous and exciting chase through forest and over fell on bringing it to bay at fifty yards he shot it in the eye mad with pain and fury it was crouching prior to springing upon him when his companion m rheinchard gamekeeper to louis duke of orleans son of philip so long regent of france by a single bullet in a vital spot shot it dead it was then measured and found to be five feet seven inches long thirtytwo inches high and only one hundred and thirty pounds in weight on the 4th of october the sieur de bauterne who was extolled as if he had been the victor of another steenkirk or fontenoy arrived triumphantly in paris and had the honour to present it to the king and then great was the astonishment and the disappointment of all who saw this animalthe terrible wild beast of gévaudan whose sanguinary career had for so many months excited such dismay there and wonder elsewhereand found that it was only a wolf after all and not a very large one horace walpole fourth earl of orfordthe brilliant and witty walpole of strawberry hillsaw the carcass as it lay in the queens antechamber at versailles and asserts that it was simply a common wolf its nature accounted for some of the peculiarities it exhibited during its ravages as the wolf according to weissenborn destroys every other creature it can master and on a moderate calculation consumes during the year about thirty times its own weight of animal substance and to increase the list of its crimes it has he adds in many instances communicated hydrophobia to man chapter iii there were giants in those days among many other strange things our unlettered ancestors believed in the past existence of those tall fellows giants individually or even collectively as nations quite as implicitly as they worthy folks did in the pranks and appearances of contemporary witches and ghosts but even among the learned a more than tacit belief in a defunct class of beings whose bulk and stature far exceeded those of common humanity found full sway until the beginning of the present century a love of the marvellous is strong and even buffon the eminent naturalist fell into the old and vague delusion that there were giants in those days and he made the bones of an elephant to figure as the remains of a man of vast stature with scripture for a basis to their assertions it was difficult no doubt for the overlearned and still more for the unlearned of past times to subdue their belief in the existence of such foes as were encountered by our old friend jack of gallant memoryveritable giants tall as steeples to whom such men as big sam of the black watch obrien the irish giant whose skeleton is in the museum of the college of surgeons even the king of prussias famous grenadiers and the girl fifteen years old and more than seven feet high who was presented to their majesties at dresden were all as pigmies and liliputians by comparison  gentlemans magazine 1753 the bible gives us four distinct races of giants the chief of whom were the anakims or sons of anak the people of the chosen land to which moses was to lead the children of israel who were unto them but as grasshoppers in size og the king of this tall race and of bashan however if judged by the measurement of the present day was not taller than eight feet six inches as his brazen bedstead measured just nine jewish cubits but the rabbis maintain that the bed described was only his cradle when an infant the anakims are referred to in the fifth chapter of the koran which speaks of jericho as a city inhabited by giants the father of og is also asserted to have been of stature so great that he escaped the flood bywading when told as we are in 1 samuel that goliath was in height six cubits and a span that his coat of mail weighed five thousand shekels of brass that the staff of his spear was as a weavers beam and that its head weighed six hundred shekels of iron it was difficult for the simple people of past days when in some remote cavern or rivers bed or fallen chalk cliff the monster bones of the elephant the mastodon or the rhinoceros came unexpectedly to light not to believe that there might have been many goliaths in the world once josephus records that in his time there were to be seen in gaza gath and azoth the tombs of those mighty men of old the sons of anak who had been slain when joshua marched into the land of canaan and slew the people of hebron and dabir according to the moslems even joshua was a man of prodigious stature and the highest mountain on the shores of the bosphorus is at this hour called by the turks the grave of joshuajuscha taghior the giants mountain  the grave is fifty feet long and has been called the tomb of amycus and of hercules tradition ascribes the origin of the name of antwerp to a giant whose abode was in the woody swamps through which the scheldt then wandered to the german sea and who used to cut off the hands and feet of those who displeased him and to prove this vide atlas geographus 1711 they show there a tooth which they pretend to be his it is a handsbreadth long and weighs six ounces moreover the city has hands cut off as part of its arms giants figure largely among the earlier fables of wales scotland and ireland the two latter contending still for the nationality of the famous finn maccoul wha dung the deil and gart him yowl and who by the famous causeway of his own construction could cross the irish channel to britain whenever he chose fiannam is probably the same personage he is said to have lived in the time of ewen ii of scotland a potentate who according to buchanan reigned in the year before christ 77 and was a good and civil king and local story connects with his name the giants chair a rock above the river dullan in the parish of mortlach england too is not without traces of some interest in the sons of anak we have the giants grave a long and grassy ridge in the beautiful fairy glen at hawkstone in salop another place so named on the coast of bristol and a third at penrith where two stone pillars in the churchyard standing fifteen feet asunder at the opposite ends of a grave and covered with runes or unintelligible carving mark the size and tomb of owen cæsarius near these pillars is a third stone called the giants thumb two miles below brougham castle on the steep banks of the eamont are two excavations in the rock having traces of a door and window and of a strong column indented with iron and these caves are assigned by tradition to a giant who bore the classic name of isis the vast stature of the patagonians was long the subject of implicit belief until it passed into a proverb antonio pagifeta who accompanied the adventurous ferdinand magellan on his famous voyage in 1519 records that on the coast of brazil they found wild and gigantic cannibals so nimble of foot that no man could overtake them bearing on thence to south latitude 49° the land seemed all desolate and uninhabited for they could see no living creature at last a giant came singing and dancing towards them and threw dust on his head he was so tall that the head of a spaniard reached only to his waist his apparel was the skin of a monstrous beast all the inhabitants were men of the same kind wherefore the admiral called them patagons this absurd story was corroborated a hundred years later by jacob le maire in a voyage to the same region and by the dutch navigator schouten when they relate that at port desire they found graves containing human skeletons from eleven to twelve feet long however the spanish officers of cordovas squadron by accurate measurements reduced the utmost stature of the real patagonian to seven feet one and a half inches and their common height to six feet premising that of course the great bones about to be referred to were those of the mammoth the mastodon and other antediluvian animals perhaps the most amusing instance of the credulity and gullibility even of the learned in such matters was a mémoire read seriously to the royal academy of sciences at rouen in the middle of the last century by a savan named m le cat therein he asserted and affected to give proof that ferragas who was slain by orlando the nephew of charlemagne was eighteen feet in height that isoret whose tomb lay near the chapel of st pierre in the suburbs of paris had been twenty feet high and that in the city of rouen when digging near the convent of the jacobins in 1509 during the reign of louis xii there was found in a tomb of stone a skeleton the skull of which would hold a bushel thirtyeight pounds weight of corn the shinbones were entire and measured four feet long on this astounding tomb was a plate of copper bearing the epitaph in this grave lies the noble and puissant lord riccon de valmont and his bones he then proceeds to tell us that valence in dauphiné possesses the bones of the giant buccart tyrant of the vivarais whom his vassal the count de cabillon slew by a barbed arrow the iron head of which was found in his tomb when itwith all his bones intactwas discovered in 1705 at the base of the mountain of crussol whereon the giant dwelt and whence he used to come daily to drink of the river merderet the skeleton when measured was twentytwo feet six inches long  in the dominican church theres the picture of a giant called buard who they pretend by his bones dug up in their monastery was fifteen cubits high and seven broadatlas geographus 1711 4to father crozart assured me continued the veracious m le cat that the physicians who were in the train of the princes who passed through valence all acknowledged the bones to be human and offered twentytwo pistoles for them he farther appends a copy of the epitaph of this personage forwarded to him by the same father crozat in 1746 and beginning hæc est effigiis gigantis baardi vivariensis tiranni in montis cressoli stantis c this tall personage a second whose bones were exposed by the waters of the rhone in 1456 and a third whose skeleton nineteen feet long was found near lucerne in 1577 were all jokes and swindle when compared with others that were found in later years particularly the remains of teutobochus king of the teutones which were discovered near the ruined castle of chaumont in dauphine in the year 1613 by some masons who were digging a well at the depth of eighteen feet in light sandy soil they came upon a tomb built of brick above it was a stone inscribed teutobochus rex five years afterwards mazurier a surgeon published his histoire véritable du géant teutobochus which excited keen controversy and brought all paristhe paris of louis the just and of richelieurushing in crowds to see the bones of the mastodon or whatever it was whose tomb bore a royal inscription this king of the teutones who is said to have been vanquished and slain in battle a few miles from valence and to have been buried with all honour by marius his conqueror was carefully measured and found to be twentyfive feet six inches long ten feet across the shoulders and five from breast to backbone his teeth were each the size of an oxs foot all france heard of this with wonder and a belief which the anatomist riolan sought in vain to ridicule and expose sicily was peculiarly the favourite abode of giants at mazarino a town near girgenti there were found in 1516 the bones of a giant whose skull was like a sugarhogshead with teeth each five ounces in weight and in the val di mazzara thirty years after the alleged remains of another were found whose stature was the same patrick brydone in his tour to sicily and malta in 1773 mentions some of these marvellous discoveries in the mountain above it il mar dolce they show you a cavern where a gigantic skeleton is said to have been found however it fell to dust when they attempted to remove it fazzello says its teeth were the only part that resisted the impression of the air that he procured two of them and that they weighed near two ounces there are many such stories to be met with in the sicilian legends as it seems to be a universal belief that this island sicily was once inhabited by giants but although we have made diligent inquiry we have never yet been able to procure a sight of any of those gigantic bones which are said to be still preserved in many parts of the island had there been any foundation for this i think it is probable they must have found their way into some of the museums but this is not the case nor indeed have we met with any person of sense and credibility that could say they have seen them we had been assured at naples that an entire skeleton upwards of ten feet high was preserved in the museum at palermo but there is no such thing there nor i believe anywhere else in the island this palermitan giant is gravely referred to in the mémoire of m le cat as well as another thirtythree feet high found in 1550 according to plutarch serbonius had the grave of antæus the libyan giant and antagonist of hercules opened in the city of tungis and finding his body to be sixty cubits long was infinitely astonished as well he might be and gave orders for the tomb to be closed but added new honours to his memory the bones of a giant fortysix cubits in length were laid bare by an earthquake in crete as pliny states with implicit faith and it was disputed whether they were those of otus son of neptune who built a city in his ninth year or of the equally fabulous orion but all that we have noted are overtopped by the giant found at thessalonica in 1691 who was ninetysix feet high as certified by m quoinet consul for france and by another found at trepani in sicilythe ancient drepanum the latter boccaccio states the learned of his time to have taken for the skeleton of polyphemus the son of neptune and thoosathe oneeyed cyclop of the odyssey a form enormous far unlike the race of human birth in stature and in face and on being measured the bones proved to be exactly three hundred feet long chapter iv buried hearts it is natural enough that the human heartdeemed by poets and philosophers to be the seat of our affections and passions of our understanding and will courage and conscience by some men looked upon as the root of life itselfshould have been considered by many of the dying in past times as a votive gift peculiarly sacred and this feeling has been the cause in many instances of the burial of the heart apart from the place where the ashes of the body might repose among the earliest instances of the separate mode of heartburial is that of henry the second of england after this luckless monarch expired in a passion of grief before the altar of the church of chinon in 1189 his heart was interred at fontevrault but his body from the nostrils of which tradition alleges blood to have dropped on the approach of his rebellious son richard was laid in a separate vault from fontevrault his heart according to a statement in a public print was brought a few years ago to edinburgh by bishop gillis of that city if so where is it now when richard cœur de lion fell beneath gourdons arrow at the siege of chaluz the gallant heart which in its greatness and mercy inspired him to forgive and even to reward the luckless archer was after his death preserved in a casket in the treasury of that splendid cathedral which william the conqueror built at rouen for richard by a last will directed that his body should be interred in fontevrault at the feet of his father to testify his sorrow for the many uneasinesses he had created him during his lifetime his bowels he bequeathed to poictou grafton has it carlisle and his heart to normandy out of his great love for the people thereof above the relic at rouen there was erected an elaborate little shrine which was demolished in 1738 but exactly a hundred years later the heart was found in its old place and reinterred it was again exhumed however cased in glass and exhibited in the musée des antiquités of the city but december 1869 saw it once more replaced in the cathedral with a leaden plate on the cover bearing the inscription hie jacet cor ricardi regis anglorum so there finally lies the heart of him who in chivalry was the rival of saladin and philip augustus the hero of the historian and the novelist and who was the idol of the english people for many a generation when this great crusaders nephew richard earl of cornwall and king of the romans died after a stirring lifeduring which he formed a conspiracy against the king his father then like all the wild pious and bankrupt lords of those days took a turn of service in the holy land and next drew his sword in the battle fought at lewes between henry the third and the confederate baronshis body was interred at hayles in gloucestershire but his heart was deposited at rewley abbey near oxford while the heart of his son who died before him and for whose tragical fate he died of grief was laid in westminster abbey in 1271 two successive holders of the see of durham made votive offerings of their hearts to two different churches the first of these was richard poore previously dean of salisbury bishop of chichester and then of durham from 1228 to 1237 he was buried in the cathedral of his diocese but his heart was sent to tarrant in dorsetshire a successor in the episcopate robert de stitchell who had formerly been prior of finchale dying on his way home from the council of lyons in 1274 was buried in durham but at his own request his heart was left behind as a gift to the benedictine convent near arbepellis in france at henley in yorkshire in the old burial vault of the noble family of bolton there lies the leaden coffin of a female member of the house who had died in france and been brought from thence embalmed and cased in lead on the top of the coffin is deposited her heart in a kind of urn the heart of agnes sorel was interred in the abbey of jumieges in scotland there have been several instances of the separate burial of the human heart the earliest known is that connected with the founding and erection of newabbey or the abbey of dulce cor in the stewartry of kirkcudbright by derorgilla daughter of alan the celtic lord of galloway and wife of john baliol of barnard castle father of the unpopular competitor for the scottish crown baliol to whom she was deeply attached died an exile in france in 1269 but derorgilla had his heart embalmed and as the scotichronicon records lokyt and bunden with sylver brycht and this relic so sad and grim she always carried about with her in 1289 as death approached when she was in her eightieth year she directed that this silent and daily companion in life for twenty years should be laid upon her bosom when she was buried in the abbey she had founded the beautiful old church the secluded ruins of which now moulder by the bank of the nith for five centuries and more in memory of her untiring affection the place has been named locally the abbey of sweetheart history and song have alike made us familiar with the last wish of robert bruce the heroic king of scotland when after two years of peace and contemplation he died in the north at cardross he desired that in part fulfilment of a vow he had made to march to jerusalem a purpose which the incessant war with england baffled his heart should be laid in the church of the holy sepulchre and on his deathbed he besought his old friend and faithful brother soldier the good sir james douglas to undertake that which was then a most arduous journey and be the bearer of the relic and it is my command he added to quote froissart that you do use that royal state and maintenance in your journey both for yourself and your companions that into whatever lands or cities you may come all may know that ye have in charge to bear beyond the seas the heart of king robert of scotland then all who stood around his bed began to weep and douglas replied assuredly my liege i do promise by the faith which i owe to god and to the order of knighthood now praise be to god said the king i shall die in peace it is a matter of history how douglas departed on this errand with a train of knights and choosing to land on the spanish coast heard that alphonso of leon and castile was at war with osman the moorish king of granada in the true spirit of the age he could not resist the temptation of striking a blow for the christian faith and so joined the spaniards he led their van upon the plain of theba near the andalusian frontier in a silver casket at his neck he bore the heart of bruce which rashly and repeatedly he cast before him amid the moors crying now pass on as ye were wont and douglas as of old will follow thee or die and there he fell together with sir william sinclair of roslin sir robert and walter logan of restalrig and others bruces heart instead of being taken to jerusalem was brought home by sir simon of lee and deposited in melrose abbey douglas was laid among his kindred in liddesdale and from thenceforward the bloody heart surmounted by a crown became the cognizance of all the douglasses in scotland bruce was interred at dunfermline and when his skeleton was discovered in 1818 the breastbone was found to have been sawn across to permit the removal of the heart in accordance with the terms of his last will but of all the treasured hearts of the heroic or illustrious dead none perhaps ever underwent so many marvellous adventures as that of james marquis of montrose who was executed by the scottish puritans in 1650 on his body being interred among those of common criminals by the side of a road leading southward from edinburgh his niece the lady napier whose castle of merchiston still stands near the place had the deal box in which the trunk of the corpse lay the head and limbs had been sent to different towns in scotland opened in the night and his heart which he had always promised at his death to leave her as a mark of the affection she had ever felt towards him was taken forth it was secretly embalmed and enclosed in a little case of steel made from the blade of that sword which montrose had drawn for king charles at the battles of auldearn tippermuir and kilsythe this case she placed in a gold filigree box that had been presented by the doge of venice to john napier of merchiston and she enclosed the whole in a silver urn which had been given to her husband by the great cavalier marquis before the civil war she sent this carefully guarded relic to the second marquis afterwards first duke of montrose who was then in exile with her husband but it never reached either of them being unfortunately lost by the bearer on the journey years after all these actors in the drama of life had passed away a gentleman of gueldres a friend of francis fifth lord napier who died in 1773 recognized in the collection of a flemish virtuoso by the coatarmorial and other engravings upon it the identical gold filigree box belonging to the napiers of merchiston the steel case was within it but the silver urn was gone the former was the size and shape of an egg it was opened by pressing down a little knob as is done in opening a watchcase inside was a little parcel containing all that remained of montroses heart wrapped in a piece of coarse cloth and done over with a substance like glue restored by this friend to the napiers it was presented to miss hester napier by her father lord francis when his speculations in the caledonian canal and elsewhere led him to fear the sale of his patrimonial castle of merchiston and that he would lose all even to this relic on which he set so much store miss napier took it with her on her marriage with johnstone of carnsalloch and it accompanied her when she sailed for india with her husband off the cape de verd isles their ship was attacked by admiral de suffrien who was also bound for the east with five french sail of the line in the engagement which ensued mrs johnstone who refused to quit her husbands side on the quarterdeck was wounded by a splinter in the arm while carrying in her hand a reticule in which she had placed all her most valuable trinkets and among these the heart of montrose as it was feared that the indiaman would be taken by boarding suffrien however was beaten off at madura in india she had an urn made like the old one to contain the heart and on it was engraved in tamil and telegu a legend telling what it held her constant anxiety concerning its safety naturally caused a story to be spread concerning it among the madrassees who deemed it a powerful talisman thus it was stolen and became the property of a chief so the loyal heart that had beat proudly in so many scottish battles hung as an amulet at the neck of a hindoo warrior the latter however on hearing what it really was generously restored it to its owner and it was brought to europe by the johnstones on their return in 1792 in that year they were in france when an edict of the revolutionary government required all persons to surrender their plate and ornaments for the service of the sovereign people mrs johnstone intrusted the heart of montrose to one of her english attendants named knowles that it might be secretly and safely conveyed to england but the custodian died by the way the relic was again lost and heard of no more in the wall of an aisle of the old ruined church of culross there was found not long ago enclosed in a silver case of oval form chased and engraved the heart of edward bruce second lord kinloss ancestor of the earls of elgin in his day a fiery and gallant young noble who fought the famous duel with a kindred spirit sir edward sackville afterwards earl of dorset a conflict which is detailed at such length and so quaintly in no 133 of the guardian bruce was the challenger and after a long and careful prearrangement attended by their seconds and surgeons they encountered each other with the sword minus their doublets and in their shirtsleeves under the walls of antwerp in august 1613 sackville had a finger hewn off and received three thrusts in his body yet he contrived to pass his rapier twice mortally through the breast of his scottish antagonist who fell on his back dying and choking with blood i redemanded of him wrote sir edward if he would request his life but it seemed he prized it not at so dear a rate to be beholden for it bravely replying that he scorned it which answer of his was so noble and worthy as i protest i could not find in my heart to offer him any more violence as sackville was borne away fainting he escaped as he relates a great danger lord bruces surgeon when nobody dreamt of it came full at me with his lordships sword and had not mine with my sword interposed i had been slain although my lord bruce weltering in his blood and past all expectation of life conformable to all his former carriage which was undoubtedly noble cried out rascal hold thy hand sackville was borne to a neighbouring monastery to be cured and died in 1652 of sorrow it was alleged for the death of charles the first kinloss died on the ground where the duel was fought and was buried in antwerp but his heart was sent home to the family vault in the old abbey church which lies so pleasantly half hidden among ancient trees by the margin of the forth and a brass plate in the wall with a detail of the catastrophe engraved upon it still indicates its locality to the visitor still more recently there was supposed to be found in the vault of the maitlands at st marys church in haddington an urn containing the heart of the great but terrible duke john of lauderdale the scourge of the covenanters a truculent peer who for his services to the powers that were was created baron petersham and earl of guildford and who died at tunbridge wells in 1682 he was buried in the family aisle amid the execrations of the peasantry to whom his character rendered him odious and his coffin on tressels was long an object of grotesque terror to the truant urchin who peeped through the narrow slit that lighted the vault where the lords of thirlstane lie the heart of the unhappy king james the second of england which was taken from his body and interred separately in an urn in the church of sainte marie de chaillot near paris was lost at the revolution in 1792 while the heart of his queen mary deste of modena and that of their faithful friend and adherent mary gordon daughter of lewis marquis of huntley and wife of james duke of perth whilom lord justicegeneral and high chancellor of scotland were long kept where the ashes of the latter still repose in the pretty little chapel of the scottish college at paris in the rue des fosses st victoire one of the oldest portions of the city when the body of the emperor napoleon was prepared for interment at st helena in may 1821 the heart was removed by a medical officer to be soldered up in a separate case madame bertrand in her grief and enthusiasm had made some vow or expressed a vehement desire to obtain possession of this as a precious relic and the doctor fearing that some trick might be played him and his commission be thereby imperilled kept it all night in his own room and under his own eye in a wineglass the noise of crystal breaking roused him if not from sleep at least from a waking doze and he started forward only in time to rescue the heart of the emperor from a huge brown rat which was dragging it across the floor to its hole it was rescued by the doctor soldered up in a silver urn filled with spirits by sergeant abraham millington of the st helena artillery and placed in the coffin during the repair of christs church at cork in 1829 a human heart in a leaden case was found embedded among the masonry but to whom it had belonged what was its story the piety or love its owner wished to commemorate no legend or inscription remained to tell in 1774 sir francis dashwood lord le despenser seems to have received the singular bequest of a human heart as the obituaries of that year record that when paul whitehead esq a gentleman much admired by the literati for his publications died at his apartments in henriettastreet covent garden among other whimsical legacies was his heart which with fifty pounds he bequeathed to his lordship but of all the relics on record perhaps the most singular if the story be true is that related in the second volume of the memoirs of the empress josephine published in 1829 when the duc de lauragnois had not only the heart of his wife to whom he was tenderly devoted but her entire body by some chemical process reduced to a sort of small stone which was set in a ring that the duke always wore on his finger after this who will say that the eighteenth century was not a romantic age chapter v phantasmagoria on the 29th of january 1719 a scottish gentleman named alexander jaffray laird of kingswells was riding across a piece of wide and waste moorland to the westward of aberdeen when about eight oclock in the morning he beheldto his great alarm and bewilderment as he states in a letter to his friend sir archibald grant of monymusk printed by the spalding cluba body of about seven thousand soldiers drawn up in front of him all under arms with colours uncased and waving and the drums slung on the drummers backs a clear morning sun was shining so he saw them distinctly and also a commander who rode along the line mounted on a white charger dubious whether to advance or retire and sorely perplexed as to what mysterious army this was the worthy laird of kingswells and a companion an old scottish soldier who had served in low country wars reined in their horses and continued to gaze on this unexpected array for nearly two hours till suddenly the troops broke into marching order and departed towards aberdeen near which he adds the hill called the stockett tooke them out of sight nothing more was heard or seen of this phantom force until the 21st of the ensuing october when upon the same groundthe then open and desolate whitemyreson a fine clear afternoon when some hundred persons were returning home from the yearly fair at old aberdeen about two thousand infantry clad in blue uniforms faced with white and with all their arms shining in the evening sun were distinctly visible and after a space the same commander on the same white charger rode slowly along the shadowy line then a long wreath of smoak apiered as if they had fired but no noise followed to add to the marvel of this scene the spectators who we have said were numerous saw many of their friends who were coming from the fair pass through this line of impalpable shadows of which they could see nothing until they came to a certain point upon the moor and looked back to the sloping ground then precisely as before those phantoms in foreign uniform broke into marching order and moved towards the bridge of the dee they remained visible however for three hours and only seemed to fade out or melt gradually away as the sun set behind the mountains this will puzzle thy philosophy adds the laird at the close of his letter to the baronet of monymusk but thou needst not doubt of the certainty of either scottish tradition and even scottish history especially after the reformation record many such instances of optical phenomena which were a source of great terror and amazement to the simple folks of those days and england was not without her full share of them either but science finds a ready solution for all such delusions now they are chiefly peculiar to mountainous districts and may appear in many shapes and in many numbers or singly like the giant of the brocken the spectators own shadow cast on the opposite clouds and girt with rings of concentric lightor like the wondrous fogbow so recently seen from the matterhorn almost on the same ground where the laird of kingswells saw the second army of phantoms and doubtless resulting from the same natural and atmospheric causes a similar appearance had been visible on the 12th of february 1643 when a great body of horse and foot appeared as if under arms on the brimman hill accoutred with matchlock pike and morion they looked ghostlike and misty as they skimmed through the gray vapour about eight oclock in the morning but on the sun breaking forth from a bank of cloud they vanished and the green hillslopes were left bare or occupied by sheep alone much about the same time another army was seen to hover in the air over the moor of forfar quhilkis visons adds the commissary spalding the people thocht to be prodigious tokens and it fell out owre trew as may be seen hereafter many such omens are gravely recorded as preceding and accompanying the long struggle of the covenant and the fatal war in which the three kingdoms were plunged by charles i and his evil advisers indigestion heavy dinners and heavier drinking had doubtless much to do in creating some of the spectral delusions of those days and inborn superstition together with a heated fancy were often not wanting as additional accessories but in the gloomy and stormy autumn that preceded the march of the scottish covenanters into england omens of all kinds teemed to a wonderful extent in the land when alaster macdonnel son of coll the devastator as the whigs named him landed from ireland at the rhu of ardnamurchan in morven to join the scottish cavaliers under the marquis of montrose then in arms for the king it was alleged that the hum of cannonshot was heard in the air passing all over scotland from the atlantic to the german sea that many strange lights appeared in the firmament and that on a gloomy night in the winter of 1650 a spectre drummer beating in succession the scottish and english marches summoned to a ghostly conference at the castlegate of edinburgh colonel dundas of that ilk a corrupt officer who on being bribed by gold afterwards surrendered to cromwell the fortress together with some sixty pieces of cannon all the private diaries and quaint chronicles of late years published by the various literary clubs in england and scotland teem with such marvels but the latter country was more particularly afflicted by them omens warnings and predictions of coming peril rendering it by their number and character extremely doubtful whether heaven or the other place was most interested in scottish affairs in 1638 fairy drums were heard beating on the hills of dun echt in aberdeenshire according to the narrative of the parson of rothiemay in 1643 we hear of the noise of drums and apparitions of armyes at bankafoir in the same county the wraith of general leslie in his buffcoat and on horseback carrying his own banner with its bend azure and three buckles or appeared on the summit of a tower at st johnstown science now explains such visions as the aerial morgana produced by the reflection of real objects on a peculiar atmospheric arrangement but then they were a source of unlimited terror law in his memorials records that in 1676 a wondrous star blazed at noon on the hill of gargunnock and a great army of spectres was seen to glide along the hills near aberdeen a folio of apparitions and wonders preserved in the british museum records that at durham on the 27th september 1703 when the evening sky was serene and full of stars a strange and prodigious light spread over its northwestern quarter as if the sun itself was shining then came streamers which turned to armed men ranked on horseback j edmonson the writer of the broadsheet adds it was thought they would see the apparition better in scotland because it appeared a great way north the same he continues gravely was seen in the latter end of march 1704 and the battle of hochstadt followed it this must refer to the second battle fought there which we call blenheim when marshal tallard was defeated and taken prisoner by marlborough but this wonderful light which turned to armed men at durham was outdone by a marvel at churchill oxfordshire where in the same collection we find that on the 9th january 1705 four suns were all visible in the air at once sent for signs unto mankind adds the publisher mr tookey of st christophers court and having their significations of the lord like the handwriting unto his servant daniel in 1744 a man named d stricket when servant to mr lancaster of blakehills saw one evening about seven oclock a troop of horse riding leisurely along souter fell in cumberland they were in close ranks and ere long quickened their pace as this man had been sharply ridiculed as the solitary beholder of a spectre horseman in the same place in the preceding year he watched these strange troopers for some time ere he summoned his master from the house to look too but ere stricket spoke of what was to be seen mr lancaster discovered the aerial troopers whose appearance was as plainly visible to him as to his servant these visionary horsemen seemed to come from the lowest part of souter fell and became visible at a place named knott they moved in successive troops or squadrons along the side of the fell till they came opposite to blakehills where they went over the mountain they thus described a kind of curvilinear path their first and last appearances being bounded by the mountain they were two hours in sight and this phenomenon was seen by every person twentysix in number in every cottage within the distance of a mile according to the statement attested before a magistrate by lancaster and stricket on the 21st of july 1745 during the middle of the last century a tollkeeper in perthshire affirmed on oath before certain justices of the peace that an entire regiment passed through his tollgate at midnight but as no such force had left any town in the neighbourhood or arrived at any other or in fact were ever seen anywhere but at his particular turnpike the whole story was naturally treated as a delusion though the highlanders sought in some way to connect the vision with the unquiet spirits of those who fought at culloden for there the peasantry aver that in the soft twilight of the summer evening solitary wayfarers when passing near the burial mounds have suddenly found themselves amid the smoke and hurlyburly of a battle and could recognize the various clans engaged by their tartans and badges on those occasions a certain laird of culduthil was always seen amid the fray on a white horse and the people believe that once again a great battle will be fought there by the clans but with whom or about what no seer has ventured to predict shadowy figures of armed men were seen in stockton forest yorkshire prior to the war with france as the leeds mercury and local prints record and so lately as 1812 much curiosity and no small ridicule were excited by the alleged appearance of a phantom army in the vicinity of hardworking prosaic leeds and all the newspapers and magazines of the time show how much the story amused the sceptical and occupied the attention of the scientific it would appear that between seven and eight oclock on the evening of sunday the 28th october mr anthony jackson a farmer in his fortyfifth year and a lad of fifteen named turner were overlooking their cattle which were at grass in havarah park near ripley the seat of sir john ingilby when the lad suddenly exclaimed look anthony what a number of beasts beasts lord bless us replied the farmer with fear and wonder they are men and as he spoke there immediately became visible an army of soldiers dressed in white uniforms and in the centre a personage of commanding aspect clad in scarlet these phantoms according to the leeds mercury and edinburgh annual register were four deep extended over thirty acres and performed many evolutions other bodies in dark uniforms now appeared and smoke as if from artillery rolled over the grass of the park on this jackson and turner thinking they had seen quite enough turned and fled like the spells of the fairy morgana which were alleged to create such beautiful effects in the bay of reggio and which fra antonio minasi saw thrice in 1773 and deemed to exceed by far the most beautiful theatrical exhibition in the world science has explained away or fully discovered the true source of all such spectral phenomena the northern aurora was deemed by the superstitious from the days of plutarch even to those of the sage sir richard baker as portentous of dire events and the fancies of the timid saw only war and battle in the shining streamers but those supposed spectral armies whose appearance we have noted were something more in most instances than mere deceptio visus being actually the shadows of realitiesthe airy reproductions of events bodily passing in other parts of the country reflected in the clouds and imaged again on the mountain slopes or elsewhere by a peculiar operation of the suns rays chapter vi a string of ghost stories a belief in the ghost of vulgar superstition is as much exploded in england now as are the opinions advanced by king james in his demonologie yet the learned bacon admitted that such things might be luther pascal guy patin milton dr johnson and even southey believed in the existence of such mediums with the unseen world my serious belief amounts to this wrote the latter that preternatural impressions are sometimes communicated to us for wise purposes and that departed spirits are sometimes permitted to manifest themselves and had pope not entertained some similar idea he had not written tis true tis certain man though dead retains part of himself the immortal mind remains the form subsists without the bodys aid aerial semblance and an empty shade upon the truth or falsehood the theories or rather hypotheses of such alleged appearances we mean not to dwell but merely to relate a few little anecdotes connected with them and drawnsave in lord broughams instancefrom sources remote and scarce in the memoirs of the celebrated agrippa daubigné grandfather of madame de maintenon the wife of louis xiv a man famous for his zeal in calvinism and disbelief in the spiritual world and one whose integrity was deemed alike rigid and inflexible we read the following of a spectre like that of a nursery tale i was he wrote in my bed and entirely awake when i heard some one enter my apartment and perceived at my bedside a woman remarkably pale whose clothes rustled against my curtains as she passed withdrawing the latter she stooped towards me and giving me a kiss that was cold as ice vanished in a moment daubigné started from bed and was almost immediately after informed of the sudden death of his mother to whom he was tenderly attached in a letter of philip second earl of chesterfield we find a curious story of a double apparition occurring at the same moment and which though it somewhat illustrates ennemosers theory of polarity is beyond the pale of modern philosophy in the gray daylight of an early morning in 1652 the earl saw a figure in white like a standing sheet appear within a yard of his bedside he attempted to grasp it but eluding him the figure slid towards the foot of the bed and melted away he felt a strange anxiety but his thoughts immediately turned to the countess lady anne percy who was then at networth with her father the earl of northumberland and thither he immediately repaired on his arrival a footman met him on the staircase with a packet directed to him from his lady whom he found with her sister the countess of essex and a mrs ramsay he was asked why he had come so suddenly he told his motive his alarm and anxiety and on perusing the letter in the sealed packet he found that the countess had written to him requesting his return as she had seen a thing in white with a black face by her bedside these apparitions were identically the same in appearance and were seen by the earl and countess at the same moment though they were in two places forty miles apart no catastrophe followed the earl however survived his lady and lived till the year 1713 in the st jamess chronicle for 1762 we find a strange story of an apparition being the means of revealing a murder and bringing the guilty parties to the fatal tree at tyburn the narrative was said to have been found among the legal papers of a counsellor of the middle temple then recently deceased in the year 1668 a young gentleman of the west country named stobbine came to london and soon after as ill luck would have it he wedded a wife of wapping the youngest daughter of a mrs alceald and in the space of fifteen months the providence of god sent them a daughter which sic was left under the care of the grandmother the husband and his wife retiring to their house in the country in 1676 when the daughter was six years old mrs alceald died and the child was sent home and remained there till 1679 when a mrs myltstre her maternal aunt having greatly increased her means forsook the canaille and low habitations of wapping came into a polite part of the town took a house among people of quality and set up for a woman of fashion and thither did she invite the stobbines and their daughter to spend the winter with her among her visitors were her husbands brother who had the title or rank of captain and who seems to have been a bully and gamestera blood in a flowing wig and laced coatand there was another relation who practised as an apothecary all these five persons dined together on the birthday of the little girl stobbine when a terrible catastrophe ensued in a spirit of play it was presumed she took up a sword that was in the room and pointing it at mr stobbine cried stick him stick him what said he would you stab your father you are not my father but captain myltstre is her father upon this boxed her ears and was instantly run through the body by the captain down he dropped we are told and then his wife her sister the captain and the apothecary all trampled upon him till he was quite dead and interring him secretly gave out that he had returned to the west country time passed on and though inquiries were made and messengers sent after the missing stobbine he was heard of no more for a time his daughter was sent to a distant school and her mother who pretended to go distracted was sent to a village a few miles out of town where the captain had a pretty little box for his convenience a memory of the terrible scene she had witnessed haunted the daughter she had nightly horrible dreams and frights to the terror of a young lady who slept with her and she always alleged that a spectre haunted her a spectre visible to her only and on these occasions she would exclaim with every manifestation of horror there is a spirit in the room it is mr stobbines spirit oh how terrible it looks these appearances and her paroxysms led to an inquiry before a justice of the peace and without any warning given the whole of the guilty parties were apprehended and committed to the gatehouse tried at the old bailey and condemned to the entire satisfaction of the county the court and all present after this stobbines troubled spirit appeared no more mrs myltstre was hanged and her body was thrown into the gullyhole near her old house in wapping mrs stobbine was strangled and burned the captain and the apothecary were hanged at tyburn and the latter was anatomized and so ended this tragedy another remarkable detection of murder through the alleged appearance of a ghost occurred in 1724 a farmer returning homeward from southam market in warwickshire disappeared by the way next day a man presented himself at the farmhouse and asked of the wife if her husband had come back no she replied and i am under the utmost anxiety and terror your terror said he cannot surpass mine for last night as i lay in bed quite awake the apparition of your poor husband appeared to me he showed me several ghastly stabs in his body which is now lying in a marlpit the pit was searched the corpse was found and the stabs in number and position answered in every way to the description given by the ghostseer to whom the spectre had named a certain man as the culprit and this person was committed to prison and brought to trial at warwick for the crime before a jury and the lord chief justice sir robert afterwards lord raymond who was succeeded in 1733 by sir philip yorke the jury would speedily have brought in a verdict of guilty but he checked them by saying gentlemen you lay more stress on the allegations of this apparition than they will bear i cannot give credit to these kind of stories we are now in a court of law and must determine according to it and i know not of any law which will admit of the testimony of an apparition nor yet if it did doth the ghost appear to give evidence crier he added call the ghost the farmers spirit being thrice summoned in vain sir robert again addressed the jury on the hitherto unblemished character of the man accused and stoutly asserted a belief in his perfect innocence adding i do strongly suspect that the gentleman who saw the apparition was himself the murderer and knew all about the stabs and the marlpit without any supernatural assistance hence i deem myself justified in committing him to close custody till further inquiries are made the result of these was that on searching his house sufficient proofs of his guilt were found he confessed his crime and was executed at the next assize in the list of the officers of the 33rd regiment when serving under lord cornwallis in america and then called the 1st west york will be found the names of captain afterwards sir john coape sherbrooke and lieutenant george wynward the former had recently joined the 33rd from the 4th or kings own regiment these young men being similar in tastes and very attached friends spent much of their time in each others society and when off duty were seldom apart one evening sherbrooke was in wynwards quarters the room in which they were seated had two doors one that led into the common passage of the officers barrack the other into wynwards bedroom from which there was no other mode of egress both officers were engaged in study till sherbrooke on raising his eyes from a book suddenly saw a young man about twenty years of age open the entrance door and advance into the room the lad looked pale ghastly and thin as if in the last stage of a mortal malady startled and alarmed captain sherbrooke called wynwards attention to their noiseless visitor and the moment the lieutenant saw him he became ashy white and incapable of speech and ere he could recover the figure passed them both and entered the bedroom good godmy poor brother exclaimed wynward your brother repeated sherbrooke in great perplexity there must be some mistake in all this follow me they entered the little bedroomit was tenantless and sherbrookes agitation was certainly not soothed by wynward expressing his conviction that from the first he believed they had seen a spectre and they mutually took note of the day and hour at which this inexplicable affair occurred wynward at times tried to persuade himself that they might have been duped by the practical joke of some brother officer yet his mind was evidently so harassed by it that when he related what had occurred all had the good taste to withhold comments and to await with interest the then slow arrival of the english mails when the latter came there were missives for every officer in the regiment except wynward whose hopes began to rise but there was one solitary letter for sherbrooke which he had no sooner read than he changed colour and left the mess table ere long he returned and said wynwards younger brother is actually no more the whole contents of his note were as follows dear john break to your friend wynward the death of his favourite brother he had died at the very moment the apparition had appeared in that remote canadian barrack strange though the story the veracity of the witnesses was unimpeachable and archdeacon wrangham alludes to it in his edition of plutarch who like pliny the younger believed in spectres of wynward we only know that he was out of the regiment soon after his brothers death and of sherbrooke that he lived to see the three days of waterloo became colonel of the 33rd commander of the forces in north america and died a general and gcb prior to accompanying his regiment the 92nd highlanders in the waterloo campaign the famous colonel john cameron of fassifern a grandson of the lochiel of the fortyfive dined with lieutenantcolonel simon macdonell of morar who had formerly been in the corps when it was embodied at aberdeen as the old 100th or gordon highlanders on the occasion of this farewell dinner there were present other officers of the regiment some of whom died very recently and it occurred in the house of morar at arasaig a wild part of ardnamurchan on the western coast of invernessshire as the guests were passing from the drawingroom towards the diningroom old colonel macdonell courteously paused to usher in cameron before him and in doing so he was observed to stagger and become pale while placing his hands before his face as if to hide something that terrified him cameron saw nothing of this though others did and all were aware that subsequently during dinner their host seemed disconcerted and out of sorts those unbidden visions known as the taisch or secondsight were alleged to be hereditary in the family of morar and hence when cameron fell at quatre bras a few weeks afterwards the old colonel asserted solemnly that at the moment when cameron passed before him he saw his figure suddenly become enveloped in a dark shroud which had bloodgouts upon it about the region of the heart but no shroud enveloped the gallant cameron when his fosterbrother buried him in the allée verte of brussels where his body lay for six months till it was brought home to kilmalie and buried under a monument on which is an inscription penned by scott one of the latest testimonies of the existence of a spiritual world is that given in the life and times of henry lord brougham written by himself in volume first he tells us that after he left the high school of edinburgh to attend the university one of his most intimate friends there was a mr g with whom in their solitary walks in the neighbourhood of the city he frequently discussed and speculated on the immortality of the soul the possibility of ghosts walking abroad and of the dead appearing to the living and they actually committed the folly of drawing up an agreement written mutually with their blood to the effect that whichever died first should appear to the other and thus solve any doubts entertained of the life after death g went to india and after the lapse of a few years brougham had almost forgotten his existence when one day in winterthe 19th of decemberas he was indulging in the half sleepy luxury of a warm bath he turned to the chair on which he had deposited his clothes and thereon sat his old collegechum g looking him coolly quietly and sadly in the face lord brougham adds that he swooned and found himself lying on the floor he noted the circumstance believing it to be all a dream and yet when remembering the compact he could not discharge from his mind a dread that g must have died and that his appearance even in a dream was to be received as a proof of a future state sixtythree years afterwards the veteran statesman and lawyer appends the following note to this story of the apparition brougham oct 16 1862i have just been copying out from my journal the account of this strange dream certissima mortis imago soon after my return there arrived a letter from india announcing gs death and stating that he died on the 19th of december singular coincidence yet when one reflects on the vast number of dreams which night after night pass through our brains the number of coincidences between the vision and the event are perhaps fewer and less remarkable than a fair calculation of chances would warrant us to expect the end billing printer guildford surrey  end of the project gutenberg ebook the queens cadet and
